Last night I was sitting here in my apartment when I got a message on Facebook from this girl named Lizz who was in my English class last semester. I haven’t talked to her since the end of last semester in December. We used to talk quite a bit in class and then after class. We also worked on several projects together during the course of the semester. Since the end of last semester, we’ve talked a few times about hanging out sometime, but it wasn’t until I got her messages last night that we actually did.

She invited me to go out to dinner with her, so I did. We went to Corona Village which is a fairly nice Mexican restaurant here and had a really good time. Afterwards, she invited me to a party that was at the house of one of her coworkers. That was also a lot of fun. I didn’t drink a whole lot as usual and neither did she, but we ended up staying until almost 4 in the morning anyway. The other drank a whole lot as is usual at parties and the girl she works with and whose house it was ended up passed out in the hallway in front of the bathroom. I don’t have any idea why you would drink so much that you pass out on the floor.

I had just had a beer the entire night, so I drove Lizz home and then went home myself and went to bed. It was a fun night. Hopefully we’ll be able to hang out again soon.
