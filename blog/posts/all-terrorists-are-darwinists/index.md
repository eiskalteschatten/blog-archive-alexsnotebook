[Something was brought to my attention](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/09/alle_terroristen_sind_darwinis.php) that I find quite hilarious actually. It is an [interview with the author of “Atlas of Creation,” Harun Yahyaha](http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,578838,00.html). The interview itself is from [Spiegel Online](http://www.spiegel.de) and is in German, but a [paraphrased version is available in English](http://bjoern.brembs.net/news.php?item.438). And I quote from the author of [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula):

> Adnan Oktar/Harun Yahya has been interviewed in Spiegel Online (that’s in German; you might want to read this short paraphrase in English). He says a number of, umm, interesting things.
> 
> – He dislikes Intelligent Design intensely, and sees it as a dishonest form of creationism.
> 
> – The Islamic terrorists aren’t actually Muslim—they are all foreign-educated Darwinist atheists. That includes Osama bin Laden.
> 
> – In the 2009 Darwin year, he plans to celebrate the collapse of Darwinism. I don’t think so.
> 
> – He claims that he can finance sending out free copies of the Atlas of Creation because he doesn’t accept royalties, so the publisher profits heavily. Uh, wait — how does the publisher profit off books that are given away?
> 
> As is commonly discovered, arch-creationists are very wacky people.

Some people are just crazy…
