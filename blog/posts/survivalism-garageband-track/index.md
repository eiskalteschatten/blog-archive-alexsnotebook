A Garageband version of Nine Inch Nail’s new single, *Survivalism*, is available to download on NIN’s official website for free. If you have an Apple computer with Mac OS X and Garageband 3 or higher installed, then you can download the file and mix it however you see fit. According to NIN’s official site, they will soon provide a place for you to upload the remixes.

They also said they plan on making a free Garageband file for remixing available for every track on their upcoming album, *Year Zero*.

For more information, visit their official site: [http://www.nin.com](http://www.nin.com) and check out the news page (or Current as they call it on their site). You can also download it there.

Unfortunately, while I have Mac OS X, I only have Garageband 2 and it wouldn’t open. If someone could let me know how it sounds or what it’s like, I would be really happy.
