Me hiking at Vedauwoo

As you probably already know from previous posts, I went hiking today with a girl named Lizz. We went to Vedauwoo which is about 16 miles east of Laramie. I’ve never actually been there before, but it was quite pretty there. Although I do have to admit it doesn’t really compare to some of the other places I’ve been to because it was mostly just rocks and dead trees. I think we may have gone a bit early to see it at its prettiest.

It was somewhat cold with the wind in places, but for the most part it wasn’t too bad. We generally stayed in the valleys and the wooded areas, so the wind didn’t really affect us a whole lot. There was still quite a bit of snow on the ground, but it was warm enough that the snow was mostly melted in the sunny areas. Unfortunately that meant that it was also muddy. It was actually surprisingly crowded. We saw several other cars there in the parking lots, although we really never saw any of the people they belonged to. Maybe they were rock climbing, maybe they were hiking down different trails, I really don’t know.

Lizz hiking at Vedauwoo

We hiked at a couple of different spots. Of course I hadn’t been to either one of them since I had never even been to Vedauwoo before. The two pictures I’ve put in this post were both taken at a spot on the first trail we hiked down. At some point, we found a stream and broke with the trail for a while. We followed the stream until we found some large rocks that were easy to climb up. They were dry and conveniently arranged almost like stairs so it was really easy to get up on top where the pictures were taken.

The other trail we went down was actually a proper trail. We followed it for about an hour when we came to the end of it. It started in campgrounds and ended in campgrounds, but it was a very pretty hike anyway. Most of it was through woods. We also saw a wood pecker pcking at a tree on our way back.

After we got through hiking, we came back to Laramie and got some lunch at Jimmy John’s. That’s been my day so far. Now I’ve got some reading I should probably do for my Native American Studies class for tomorrow. I don’t really have any other homework, so I should be finished fairly quickly.
