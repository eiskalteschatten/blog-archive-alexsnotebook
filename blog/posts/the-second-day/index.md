Today was much better than yesterday. Mostly because I’m not so tired.

Nina picked me up at 11:00 this morning and then we went to Kayla’s dorm. Nina brought some breakfast food that we ate in Kayla’s kitchen. We had rolls with cheese, butter, chicken and some sort of strange sauce. After we had breakfast, we went to meet our advisor here in Oldenburg. We were there for most of the day because he sells bikes and he had to fit Kayla’s computer’s power adapter with a German plug (he had to cut off the American one and splice a German plug on).

Afterwards, we went to go get the sheets and everything that we couldn’t get last night. We finally got those, then went downtown again to do some shopping. We looked at cell phones. It looks like a phone will cost me about 50-80 € ($70-109) for the cheapest plus the cost of minutes. I have 2 options to pay without a contract. Either I can buy the pre-paid cards as I need them, which are about 0.49 € ($0.70) a minute, or I can open a German bank account and sign up for a plan that can be cancelled anytime. I would pay for only the minutes and services I use each month like I would with the pre-paid cards. The minutes would be 0.03 € ($.04) a minute instead of 49 cents. I think I may do that.

We also went into a department store called H&M. I bought a jacket there because my Wyoming sweatshirt caused me to stick out like a sore thumb since Germans don’t wear hoodies.

Then afterwards, we went to the grocery store, where we bought some food and I bought a much needed towel (I forgot to bring one and had to dry off today with the shirt I wore yesterday).

Tomorrow, I’m going to turn in my rental agreement and meet the landlady. Then Nina is going to pick me and Kayla up again at around 11:30 and we’re going to go register with the Town Hall and get our temporary residence permits. We’re also going to go downtown again and do some more shopping (what fun……). Then later we’re probably going to some sort of fair going on downtown.
