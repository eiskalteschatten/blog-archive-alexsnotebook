> A Florida congresswoman has introduced a new bill targeting Apple, aiming to boost competition and expand consumer choice by mandating third-party marketplaces like the EU.

> U.S. Representative Kat Cammack (R-FL) has introduced the [App Store Freedom Act](https://cammack.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-cammack-introduces-app-store-freedom-act-promote-competition-protect) ([via The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/662180/app-store-freedom-act-apple-third-party-app-stores)), a bill aimed at increasing competition and consumer choice in the mobile app marketplace. The legislation targets major app store operators—those with over 100 million U.S. users—including the App Store.
> 
> If enacted, the bill would require these companies to allow users to install third-party app stores and designate them as default, grant developers equal access to development tools, and permit the use of third-party payment systems. Additionally, it mandates the ability to remove or hide pre-installed apps—something Apple already does.
> 
> The bill also seeks to prevent app stores from forcing developers to use the company’s in-app payment systems, imposing pricing parity requirements, or punishing developers for distributing their apps elsewhere. Violations could lead to penalties from the Federal Trade Commission and civil fines up to $1 million per infraction.

First of all, it’s always weird reading about Kat Cammack in the news because I went to school with her. Secondly, I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, more competition might lead to better pricing if developers don’t have to compensate for Apple’s fees.

On the other hand, I have a feeling this might lead to a fracturing of the ecosystem which would lead to a much more disjointed user experience. Frankly, I don’t want to have to download and install multiple app stores just to access the apps that I want. Plus, if Apple forces apps to use its in-app payment system, it makes the purchasing experience for users much more consistent and convenient. The current system is particularly useful with subscriptions since you can see them all in one place and easily cancel them at any time.

That said, maybe the issue that really needs to be tackled here is Apple’s fee structure. If Apple were forced to give up the 15%/30% fees they take from every in-app purchase, then it would solve both problems. Prices would fall, developers would earn more and users still get a consistent experience.

As far as being able to install apps with alternative app stores goes, I would prefer the ability to download them directly from the internet and install them much like you can for macOS, Android or any other operating system. Apple can still notarize the apps (like they do for macOS), but that would allow developers to offer apps directly to users without having to install multiple app stores.
