In my free time this past weekend, I’ve been working on finalizing a few convenience features and fixing a sandbox bug I’m really glad I caught before releasing ScratchPad 2.0 to the public. Otherwise, I’ve been testing quite a bit and am very happy with how it’s currently running.

However, one thing I discovered is that a quick search on the App Store shows that there are already two applications called “Scratchpad” (see screenshot above). While the casing is different (Scratchpad vs ScratchPad), it’s essentially still the same name. So the question now is whether I should rename my application.

Many years ago, before Apple Notes existed, I started work on a much more expansive version of ScratchPad that would have essentially had the same features as Apple Notes. I abandoned it because, well, it was [sherlocked](https://www.simplymac.com/apps/what-does-sherlocking-an-app-mean) before I was even far enough along to release it.

That project I dubbed “ScratchBook” which seems like it might be a fitting new name for ScratchPad. Searching for “ScratchBook” in the App Store didn’t return any results, so I may end up going with that.

Even if I decided not to rename it, Apple still may reject the submission due to other apps already having the same name. I may try it anyway and see what happens. Or I might rename it so that it’s easier to search for and find.

What do you think about it?
