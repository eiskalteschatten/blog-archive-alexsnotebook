[This](http://gizmodo.com/341802/bill-gates-explains-the-difference-between-microsoft-and-apple) is actually an interesting video. Bill Gates explains the difference between Apple’s approach and Microsoft’s approach to product releases and, surprisingly enough, he actually does a fair job of it I think.

It’s a relatively short clip, but worth watching if you have any remote interest in either company.
