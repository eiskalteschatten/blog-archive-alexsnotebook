A couple of days ago I got an notification that there was an update to the software I normally use for keeping track of all of my various blogs and my journals. The software is called [Journler](http://journler.com/). I have to admit that I really like the software, but with the update came a new license saying that it was becoming shareware. It used to be something they called donationware which is where a user can choose to donate if they like the software.  
I donated some money because I really liked the software, but according to the new license, I will have to buy the program if I want to continue using it despite having already donated the same amount the program will cost me ($40). I don’t know about you, but for me that was enough for me to uninstall the program and start using Word and a system of folders in my Documents folder as my new journal/blog organizing system.  
As such, I have removed Journler from my [Mac Software list](http://alexseifert.wordpress.com/mac-software). I’m quite disappointed because I really liked the program, but I will no longer be using it.
