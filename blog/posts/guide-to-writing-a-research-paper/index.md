For the past couple of nights I have been working on a guide for writing a research paper that I can post to the Wisdom of the Crowd website. The reason for this is because the English 1010 final is just around the corner. The final is a research paper and will be the first college-level research paper that many of those student write.

We are also trying to make the site as useful as possible to help drive traffic to the site. Hopefully once the research paper is formally assigned, having a guide on the website will help attract English 1010 students.

As of now, the paper is in the revision process. I have submitted it to the Director of Composition and Writing here as well as some of the English 1010 instructors and the other peer instructor (I am also a peer instructor for the Wisdom of the Crowd project). Once I get it back, I will put it up on the website. It turned out to be about 8 pages single-spaced, all of which I wrote in the past two nights. Itâ€™s quite a hefty guide.
