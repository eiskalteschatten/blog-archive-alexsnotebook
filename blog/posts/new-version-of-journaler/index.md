\[digg=http://www.digg.com/software/New\_Version\_of\_Journler\]A new version of my favorite blogging software, Journler, has just been released. The new version is 2.5 and includes a very spiffy interface upgrade to match that of the 7.0+ versions of iTunes.

Version 2.5 includes more than just an interface overhaul. According to their new features list, you will find features such as: 

**Writer-in-Mind Features** 

A half dozen features for the writer in all of us. Live word count, spelling auto-correction, smart quotes and much more.

**Snapshot: A Picture in Your Entry** 

Journler already did video and audio, now it does pictures as well. Forgot your camera but have an iSight enabled Mac? Quickly add a picture to your entry.

**Mail Integration** 

Send attached files and media directly to Mail, including them with your entry’s text. You can also copy Mail messages into your journal as a permanent reference. And of course you can view them right inside Journler.

**The Lexicon** 

View the document-term relationships in your journal or right click a word in an entry or file and instantaneously jump to any other occurrence of that word anywhere in any of your entries or media. Oh yeah.

and of course, there’s also more. I have yet to play with all of the new features.

You can find it as a free download for private, non-profit use on their website: [http://www.journler.com](http://www.journler.com)
