It was almost a year ago that I [introduced](https://blog.alexseifert.com/2024/05/06/introducing-notes/) the section on my blog that I’ve called “[Notes](https://blog.alexseifert.com/category/notes/).” It is the part of the blog where I write small posts about various things I’ve found on the internet or thoughts I’ve had. In contrast to the rest of the blog, the posts are fairly short and frequently include block quotes from other sources.

In any case, the page has used the same design as all of the other categories on the page: a list of article titles, summaries and images. I’ve now changed that to use a traditional blog-style format. That means you can now read the Notes section without having to click on each individual post.

This makes more sense for this part of the website because Notes are designed to be quick and easily readable. The traditional blog design makes less sense for the rest of the website where the articles tend to be longer and include more images.

You can check out the new design on the [Notes page](https://blog.alexseifert.com/category/notes/).
