I’ll be taking over the Weekly Metal Philosophy for the next few weeks as NP has had some other things come up and doesn’t really have time to continue with them for now.

This week’s topic is leaving your band.

I have to say from experience that this is a tough thing to do; especially if you don’t really want to leave the band. You might ask why you would leave your band if you don’t want to. Well, there are some circumstances that force you to do such a thing.

A good example of that is me and one of my current bands: **Those Guys Again**. Later this year, I will be moving to Germany for a year long study abroad program at a university there. This requires that I leave Those Guys Again despite the fact that I don’t really want to. I don’t have to leave my other band, **Asson**, as we are simply a studio band that has never performed live, so a year-long break won’t do any harm.

The toughest part of leaving is announcing that you’re leaving; especially if you’re a founding member of the band. I’ve known I’m going to Germany for several months now, but I’ve only just told my band this week. The disappointment throughout the band was quite tough to bear.

The best time to announce your departure is at the end of a long, successful practice. Everyone is tired, but feeling good. You don’t want to make the announcement after a good show because that ruins the moment of triumph you feel after a successful show; and you don’t want to make the announcement after an unsuccessful practice either or the other members may feel that you just don’t care about them anymore (thus being why you probably performed poorly during practice).

This, of course, only applies if you don’t want to leave your band. If you get into a serious argument or something else happens that results in you leaving, that’s a whole different topic.
