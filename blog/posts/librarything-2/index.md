So I broke down and decided to catalog my ever-growing personal library. I chose to use an online tool called [LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com) because it seemed like a good way of keeping track of everything. There are other tools out there that I considered, many of which are offline, however most of them cost money and I didn’t want to spend money on something when I can get it for free. LibraryThing seems like a good tool. I haven’t cataloged my entire library yet, only what I happen to have on hand with me at the moment. All 38 books. I actually have a much larger collection of books though.

If you are interested, you can view my library [here](http://www.librarything.com/catalog/eiskalteschatten). I will also be putting a link to my library catalog as a button on the right side of the blog so you can view it at anytime.

If you have any books that you think I should add to my library or any comments, feel free to leave me a comment on this post or any other post.
