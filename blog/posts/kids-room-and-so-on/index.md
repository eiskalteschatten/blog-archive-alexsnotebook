Well, I’ve released my newest album, Kid’s Room. The official release date is August 21, 2007, but it’s now just starting to hit the stores. From the feedback I’ve gotten from several people I know who have already listened to it, I can firmly say that I have very strong expectations for this album and I think this is going to be my best selling one yet. I’m excited to see what you guys think of it.

The next album is already well underway. Already, I’ve got 9 songs done for it, a name and an album cover (subject to change). The album’s name is Parlour. I’ve been experimenting with a style that branches from the new style of Kid’s Room, but of course takes the music in a slightly different direction. I can’t give any more details right now because I don’t have any more details to give. I’ll post them here as they become available though.
