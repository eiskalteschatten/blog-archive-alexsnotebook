I’ve lived here for a long time. My family before me also lived here. But I’m the last one that will live here. I have no kids; no wife.

No one comes here and I don’t go out. Why would I? I need no food; no water.

I’ve been dead for a long time and yet, I continue to live. I was born 150 years ago and died 132 years ago. My house is empty and there isn’t anything to do. I have no friends; no desire to be.
