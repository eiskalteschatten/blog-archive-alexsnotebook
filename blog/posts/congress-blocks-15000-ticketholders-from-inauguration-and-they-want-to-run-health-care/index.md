There is [a great blog entry](http://www.lp.org/blogs/donny-ferguson/congress-blocks-15000-ticketholders-from-inauguration-and-they-want-to-run-heal) on the Libertarian Party website that I think is definitely work reading. It’s entitled “Congress blocks 15,000 ticketholders from inauguration — and they want to run health care?” Here is part of it:

> Thousands of now-angry people secured tickets to the historic inauguration of Barack Obama through the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and stood in line for hours on a frigid D.C. morning — only to be told they wouldn’t be allowed to see the event.
> 
> So you spent thousands of dollars on airline tickets, a hotel and new clothes. You traveled thousands of miles to wake up in the early morning and wait in freezing temperatures. You’ve stood in line for hours holding a ticket from Congress itself allowing you to witness a historic event at the Capitol.
> 
> All so you can be hustled out like you’re homeless. But hey, Congress is at least mailing you a picture of Barack Obama.
> 
> And these people think they should control your access to health care? What does your surviving family get if you’re refused cancer treatment, as is often done in countries with socialized medicine? A signed photo of Tom Daschle?
