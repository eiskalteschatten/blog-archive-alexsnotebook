I’m posting this entry now to let everyone know that I’m basically going to disappear for a couple of weeks. On Friday I’m going to a friend’s house in Rostock (the same friend I visited earlier), then on Saturday I’m going to go with him to his parents’ house. I’ll be spending Christmas and the New Year with them and I’m really looking forward to it. I will probably be able to check my e-mail and get on the internet a little bit, but most likely not very often.

Of course I’ll write about what I do there and post it here when I get back. I also plan on taking photos which, of course, I’ll also post here.

Until then, Merry Christmas!
