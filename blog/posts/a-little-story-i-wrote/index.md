I wrote a short story today. I was bored. If you want to read it, you can find it [here](http://alexgermany.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/together-to-one.pdf).

As I mentioned in my last entry, tomorrow is the first day of orientation for international students. I’m actually looking forward to it because it’s something to do. We’ll see how it goes.

Enjoy the story.
