For those of you who can’t wait for Nine Inch Nail’s new album, **Year Zero**, to come out, you’re in luck. Nine Inch Nails has released the album in its entirety for streaming on their [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/nin).

I’ve listened to several of the songs and I have to say that everyone of them that I’ve listened to has been really good.
