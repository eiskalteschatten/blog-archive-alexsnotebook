The weather cooperated today which means the hiking trip tomorrow is on. It was overcast for part of the day, but it didnâ€™t snow as the forecast had predicted it would. It was even sunny and warmed up towards the end of the day. Hopefully it will be warm tomorrow as well. I am not concerned about snow tomorrow, just the temperature. It is supposed to be sunny.
