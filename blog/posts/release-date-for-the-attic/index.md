I am very pleased to announce that we now have an official release date for “The Attic”! The release date will be **June 24th, 2011**.

You can already see the album’s tracklisting and artwork as well as listen to the songs from the album online on the site’s [music player](https://www.alexseifertmusic.com/music/). The only song you cannot listen to yet is the new song, Dschungel. You will have to wait until the 24th before you can listen to that track!
