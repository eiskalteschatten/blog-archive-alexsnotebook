Well, it will soon be time for my European adventures to begin. I leave on Monday, August 27. In the afternoon around 1:30, I will fly to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to meet a friend of mine from the University of Wyoming who will also be going to Oldenburg. Then that night around 8:00, we will fly to Frankfurt together. If everything goes according to plan, we will arrive in Frankfurt around 10:30 am or so on the morning of August 28. From there, once we pass through customs and everything, we will take a train from Frankfurt to Oldenburg. The train ride will be about 6 hours. Once we arrive in Oldenburg, we will be staying at the youth hostel there for 3 nights, then at a German friend’s apartment for 1 night before we can move into our dorm rooms on September 1.

Our first course (a special language course for us exchange students to get us used to the German language, taking notes in German, listening to lectures in German, etc), will begin September 3 and end on September 21. We then have a month off until the beginning of our regular courses, which begin on October 22.

So far, that’s the plan. I’m not entirely sure what we’ll be doing between arriving in Oldenburg and starting our first language course, but I am sure that we’ll probably find something to do.
