Since my PowerBook’s hard drive died, I have been forced to use Windows Vista Home Basic on a Dell Inspiron 1521 for the past week. It has been an absolute nightmare! In lieu of this, I’ve started keeping a running log of things that have gone wrong with Windows everyday. I will be making daily posts with lists of problems I encounter. Some of them are more entertaining than others, but most of them are stupid.

Here is the list for October 3, 2008:

-   Wouldn’t boot. Had to restart twice.
-   Clicked a bookmark and the titlebar of the window moved to the cursor instead of the browser going to the bookmark.
-   Scroll down a webpage and it automatically comes back up.
-   Explorer crashed and took all open program (iTunes & Pidgin) with it.
-   Blue screen of death.
-   Windows locked itself up trying to find a solution for the blue screen of death.
-   Explorer crashed.
-   Computer went to sleep, internet wouldn’t work afterwards. Had to restart.
-   Trying to rename a file in Windows Explorer, but instead menus keep opening. (Alt-button is not a problem; closed the window and tried in a new window, same results).
