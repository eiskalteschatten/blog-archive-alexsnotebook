Today was an entirely uneventful, albeit long, day. I had class from 10 am to 5 pm and other than that, I pretty much did nothing. I read a bit for my historical methods class which generally requires an absurd amount of reading each week despite the fact that we also are supposed to be working on our research projects. Other than that, I really havenâ€™t done much of anything today.
