I know everyone is going to call me crazy, but I’ve started yet another blog. This one is called [“History Rhymes”](http://historyrhymes.wordpress.com/) and focuses on 19th century postbellum American history. I chose to start this blog because I am currently studying American history at my university as an undergraduate and will hopefully soon start at a graduate level. My studies are going to really focus on the post-Civil War settlement of the American west, the Indian Wars, etc.

Anyway, I will be using [History Rhymes](http://historyrhymes.wordpress.com/) as a place to vent some of my findings and share them with everyone.

You can find the new blog here: [http://historyrhymes.wordpress.com](http://historyrhymes.wordpress.com/).
