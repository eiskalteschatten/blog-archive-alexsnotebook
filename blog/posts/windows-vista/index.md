All I have heard about Microsoft’s new Windows Vista is negative things. I admit that I haven’t really gone into to much depth as far as researching facts goes, but as a consumer, I shouldn’t have to. The media (including various blogs I’ve seen) have so far given a very negative attitude towards the new OS.

For example, I visited PCWorld’s website [http://www.pcworld.com](http://www.pcworld.com) and the first thing that I see on the homepage is an article entitled: “The Most Annoying Things About Windows Vista”. For those of you interested in reading it, you can find it [here](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,129126-page,1/article.html). Despite negative reactions such as this, however, Microsoft’s chairman, Bill Gates, has been quoted as saying that the Vista launch has been “incredible” and that “The reviews have been fantastic”. (Related Article: [http://www.news.com](http://news.com.com/Gates+Vistas+had+incredible+reception/2100-1016_3-6160914.html))

I don’t know about you, but I don’t know what reviews Bill Gates has been looking at recently. Here’s quite a large list of the reviews I’ve seen (all of them negative…):
