“The Attic” just came out and I am already hard at work on the next album. Several songs have already been completed for it and the artwork is also practically finished. There are two or three more songs still that need to be finished before the album can get ready to be released, but I’m hoping that won’t take too long.

A name is still being decided for the album and progress is still not far enough along to have a release date picked yet, but I am hoping it will be out at the end of this year or the beginning of 2012. We will see though.

Check back here for updates as the album draws nearer to completion!
