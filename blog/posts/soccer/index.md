Yesterday was a lot more eventful that I thought it would be. I got up at about 11 and met Kayla and some of the others at the Schlossgarten (the castle gardens) which is a big park near the Oldenburg palace. There we had a picnic for about 2 or 3 hours. It was fun and the weather was the hottest I think I have experienced here yet (about 70 degrees or so I think). It’s already starting to get really humid too.

After the picnic, I came back home and Orion, Jonathan and I all went to a different park closer to where we live to play some soccer. We kicked around the ball for a while and eventually some Germans came over and asked us if we wanted to play a pick up game. And so we did. At first it was 4 on 4 with Orion and Jonathan being on the opposite team from me. I managed to score 1 goal in the game. Then some more people came over and wanted to play, so we made the field larger and the teams where now 6 on 6. I scored another goal during that game. I was the only American to score any goals as the other 2 didn’t score any. The Germans on the other team were embarrassed to have been scored on (twice) by an American who calls the game soccer instead of football. I found that funny.

Since that’s really the first time I’ve exercised that much I am extremely sore today. It hurts to stand up and it hurts to walk. Either way, Orion, Jonathan and I are going back tomorrow after classes to play again. Hopefully there will be some more people there to play with.
