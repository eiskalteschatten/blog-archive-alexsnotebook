It seems like Harvard Law School got a pretty good deal on that geninue copy of the Magna Carta. Of course, they didn’t know was geniune at the time of purchase or they wouldn’t have paid a petty $27.50 for it.

The article goes into a lot of detail about how they determined it was geniune and also gives a little bit of history about the document. It’s a very interesting read.
