> Clifton Sellers attended a Zoom meeting last month where robots outnumbered humans.

> He counted six people on the call including himself, Sellers recounted in an interview. The 10 others attending were note-taking apps powered by artificial intelligence that had joined to record, transcribe and summarize the meeting.

> Major workplace tools such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet offer note-taking features that can record, transcribe and use AI to summarize meetings a person is invited to but doesn’t attend. A profusion of smaller companies, such as [otter.ai](http://otter.ai/), offers apps that workers can use to send AI meeting agents to capture calls in a similar way. OpenAI’s ChatGPT recently added a [record mode](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487532-chatgpt-record) that can function as a meeting note taker. (The Washington Post has a content partnership with OpenAI.)

> Participants can’t send their note takers to present to a meeting on their behalf — yet. Zoom CEO Eric Yuan [has said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuHOo6bLEic) the company wants to allow users to create “digital twins,” or AI assistants, that can eventually attend meetings for people and take action in their place.

Where can I get one of these?!? That’s my first reaction as meetings tend to be my least productive time. However, I will also admit that the regular contact with the rest of my team that meetings provide has become much more important while working remotely. In a way, the regular meetings and discussions have become the glue holding the team together.

Of course, there are also the privacy implications of AI note-takers:

> Sending an AI bot to experience things in your absence could be the next logical step after social media and smartphones created the expectation that anything that can be recorded, will be.
> 
> “We’re moving into a world where nothing will be forgotten,” Allie K. Miller, CEO of Open Machine, which helps companies and executives deploy AI, said in a phone interview last week. Always-on recording is changing human behavior, she said, from college parties to corporate boardrooms.

> She advises people to remember that there’s no medium — on or offline — that means you’re safe from being recorded. And if someone skipped a meeting and sent an AI note taker instead, consider that the person may later read or hear anything you say in their absence.

I wonder what EU law has to say about it given that I live in the EU and this article is from American media.
