I’ve started a new blog called [Manifestly Absurd](http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com). There I will be writing posts on various things that I find entirely absurd and what I find very logical. You can find the blog here: [http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com](http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com).

I decided to host this new one on Blogger just to give it a try since I use a lot of Google’s other services. So far there are a lot of things I like about it that WordPress doesn’t have, but there are a lot of things Blogger doesn’t have that WordPress has. We’ll see how it goes.

I will be letting everyone know here as well when I post something new on [Manifestly Absurd](http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com).
