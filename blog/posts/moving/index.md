Well, today I helped Dieuwertje move out of her apartment. Her parents and one of her younger sisters came with their car and a trailer to bring her back to the Netherlands. I helped her dad move the larger pieces of furniture while Dieuwertje, her mom and her sister packed and brought the smaller stuff outside. It was really nice to meet her family. They could all speak enough English to hold a conversation fortunately, because I can’t speak any Dutch really. After moving her out, we went to a bakery and had lunch. Then they left for Groningen and I came back to my room. She also bought my bass, so that is now taken care of.

Later today, I’m going to a party at Hester’s place. It will probably be the last time I see most of the other exchange students (other than the others from Wyoming). In the meantime, I think I’m going to repack and see if I can’t get the weight of my suitcases down.
