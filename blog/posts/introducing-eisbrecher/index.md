I’m not entirely sure as to how many of you out there have heard of the German band Eisbrecher, but they are very quickly gaining in popularity not only in German and the USA, but worldwide. You can go down to any Sam Goody or Tower Records and pick up a copy of either of Eisbrecher’s two albums or even their four singles.

Eisbrecher (Icebreaker) is a band that pushes the boundaries of the electronic/dance genre and the heavy rock genre. They, in my opinion, have found a perfect combination of the two genres. Most of their songs are supported by a very strong dance beat with heavy metal guitars combined with techno/electronic music to form the melody. The vocals of the singer, Alexx Wesselsky, are extremely powerful and can be compared to the strength of Till Lindemann’s vocals in Rammstein.

Eisbrecher was formed by two former Megaherz members: Alexx Wesselsky and Noel Pix. Alexx was the original frontman/singer for Megaherz and created several albums with them. As Eisbrecher, they have released two albums: Eisbrecher (Icebreaker) and Antikörper (Antibodies). Right before the release of their second album, Antikörper, four more members hopped on board to play guitar, bass, keyboard and drums during live performances. Their live performances focus more on the heavy metal aspect of their music, rather than the electronic parts.

Before my server went down (yes, I had my own server at one point), I used to operate a fansite for Eisbrecher. The site was [http://www.eswirdkalt.com](http://www.eswirdkalt.com). Eventually, I hope to get it back up and running. Because of this fansite, I had the opportunity to exchange several e-mails with the singer, Alexx.

Now that I’ve probably bored you with details, I’ll tell you how you can hear them. You can hear free samples here: [http://eb.herzeleid.com/media/thumbnails.php?album=8](http://eb.herzeleid.com/media/thumbnails.php?album=8). My personal recommendations as far as samples are concerned are: *Eisbrecher,* *Eiskalt Erwischt, Kein Mitleid, Leider, Mein Blut and Vergissmeinnicht*.

Their official site is here: [http://www.eis-brecher.com](http://www.eis-brecher.com) and it’s in both English and German.
