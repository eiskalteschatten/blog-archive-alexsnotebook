There still isn’t really a whole lot going on here as usual. Today I went to one of my 2 classes because the other one was canceled. I then came home and started working on my presentation that I have to do in the class I did go to today. The class is called “Arbeiten, Sprechen und Referieren” (Working, Speaking and Presenting) and is part of the German for foreigners program they have here. All of us in that class have to do a 30 minute presentation leading into class discussion on any topic we want to. I wanted to do it on something American western history related and eventually decided to do it on cowboys since I have to engage the class somehow in discussion. That means I needed to choose a topic that the others will have some sort of familiarity with. I’m going to be comparing what you see in movies and literature to what they actually were since everyone here is familiar with westerns, but they don’t know how it actually was. In fact, I think westerns are more popular here than in the US.

I have no plans for tomorrow, but Saturday evening, I’m going over to another American’s place for a BBQ. He invited a whole bunch of people. Hopefully the weather won’t be cold like it has been the past couple of weeks. It was really hot for a while, then suddenly it got cold again.
