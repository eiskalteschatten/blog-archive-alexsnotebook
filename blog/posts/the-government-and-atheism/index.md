\[digg=http://www.digg.com/political\_opinion/The\_Government\_and\_Atheism\_3\][An article I read](http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10277230&top_story=1) this morning brought to my attention something quite alarming from my perspective. As an atheist, I didn’t realize that how much of a lack of political power atheists have. I suppose that it makes sense for public relation purposes that presidential and other high office candidates announce some sort of religious association, but at the same time, I do find it kind of troubling; especially when presidential candidates denounce atheism openly in public speeches such as Mitt Romney did.

> “\[Mitt\] Romney recently gave a speech extolling religious liberty, decrying religious ‘tests’ for office, and invoking the faith of some of America’s founding fathers. All this, naturally, was designed to help his quest for the presidency. The speech thrilled many religious conservatives, and plenty of pundits thought it served him well politically too. But members of one minority with virtually no political success in America were left sputtering with frustration. America’s atheists and agnostics felt excluded when Mr Romney said that ‘freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom…freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone.'”

I won’t be voting for Mitt Romney anytime soon from this quote alone. While he might be the first mormon presidential hopeful, his intolerance for the lack of religion is quite apparent. The article did have some good suggestions as to what atheists should do however to gain more political power:

> “If these growing ranks concentrate on areas where American religiosity can do harm—over-aggressive proselytising in the armed forces, undermining science or AIDS programmes, alienating minorities at home and Muslims abroad—they could wield the sort of influence that any other minority representing 10% of the country might do…”

I would highly recommend the read to anyone interested. You can find the article here: [http://www.economist.com](http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10277230&top_story=1)
