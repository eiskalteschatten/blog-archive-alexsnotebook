For those of you who don’t know who the rock band Asson is, let me fill you in.

Asson is a band started by me. I am the drummer. The band is made up of four people: Christoph and Joey on guitar, Jeff on bass and me on drums. We currently do mostly instrumentals as we have no singer. So far, we only have one song with vocals called “The Trial” with guest vocals done by the brother of a friend of mine, Ty.

Anyway, today we just finished another song. This one is called “Why?”. The drums are somewhat different that what I’ve done in the past and are really fun to play. If anyone wants tabs, let me know. I’ve uploaded the new song on our website so you can download it if you want. Let me know what you think of it.
