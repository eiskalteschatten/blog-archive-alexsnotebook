Today was a rather uneventful day. I went to my classes in the morning and early afternoon and then came home. I talked to Dieuwertje (some of you may know her as DiDi) for the first time on Skype. She downloaded it and installed it. It was really nice to actually talk to her and not just chat through instant messenger. I also ended up talking to one of her sisters, her mom and her dad over the course of our conversation on Skype. Afterwards, I talked to Jake on the phone, then I talked to Kyle on the phone. Then I went to Walmart and bought groceries and came back and ate dinner. Then I talked to my dad on the phone and that’s pretty much been my day. Lots of talking on the phone. Now I think I’m going to read for a while for my Native American Studies class because I need to read 2 chapters for class on Monday. Not a whole lot, but it still needs to get done.
