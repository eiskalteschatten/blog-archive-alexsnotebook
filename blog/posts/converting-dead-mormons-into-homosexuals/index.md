I found a [very humorous blog entry](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/11/20/145340/48/889/664239) about the Mormons continuing to posthumously baptize Jewish Holocaust victims into the Church of the Latter Day Saints. The author’s idea for revenge is quite cruel when looked upon from a Mormon’s point of view, but quite hilarious when looked upon from another point of view. The author proposes to convert dead Mormons into homosexuals. A quote from the blog entry:

> Dear God of the Homos,
> 
> With your great and everlasting love that blessed the covenants of Achilles and Petroclus, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, and of Jonathon and David, bless then the soul of Joseph Smith of Sharon, Vermont with your divine penis. Let it pierce the anus of his soul, and let you be forever joined to him, since on this oppressive earth, he was denied the pleasure of the male sex.
> 
> Forever and ever, our brother Joseph Smith has now joined our family (We Sing the Hymn to Praise God of the Homos!).
> 
> Blessed be God of the Homos,
> 
> Amen
