Over the past couple of months, I’ve toyed around with the idea of starting a new blog which I was going to call Systemberg. It was going to be a blog where I was going to post more frequently than here and with more opinions on primarily technology-related topics. This is the original announcement I was going to make:

> Today, I’m happy to announce yet another blog project called [Systemberg](https://www.systemberg.com). It is a new blog that I’ve started to serve as a place where I can create less formal posts about current affairs in the mainstream media or about technology than you would usually find on [my other blogs](https://blog.alexseifert.com/other-blogs/). As such, you’ll find the design itself is quite different in that it is a much more traditional blog design without much emphasis on images.
> 
> Hopefully, you’ll find it interesting and informative, even if you disagree with some of my views on what is going on.

I set up a WordPress instance for it, posted a couple of things, then took it back down. About a month later, I revamped the custom WordPress theme I was using for it, set it back up, posted a couple of things, then took it back down again.

The reason for that is because it felt superfluous. After all, I have this blog with its “[Notes](https://blog.alexseifert.com/category/notes/)” section which is exactly what it was designed to be used for. So, I decided to take it down again and this time for good. Too many blogs is stressful and I need to keep reminding myself of that.

I did import the posts I created there into this blog, so they still exist. If you want to see them, they are tagged “[Systemberg](https://blog.alexseifert.com/tag/systemberg/)“.
