\[digg=http://digg.com/apple/Impersonal\_Corporations\]It amazes me at just how heartless some corporations can be sometimes. What I mean by that can be easily demonstrated in the now famous case of Apple sending a cease and desist letter to a nine year old girl. If you are unfamiliar with this, let me explain quickly. A nine year old girl sent a letter to Apple explaining some of her ideas of how they could improve the iPod Nano. Plain and simple. A couple of months later, the girl received a reply letter from Apple’s legal department telling her that they do not accept unsolicited ideas for their products and that she should not send anymore letters to Apple.

I understand that is a standard procedure and everything, but in order for them to have known what the contents of the letter the girl sent were, they would have had to open it and read at least part of it. Since it was a handwritten letter, immediately they should have seen by the handwriting that this was a letter sent by a little kid who only wanted to share some ideas with the company. Now, I wouldn’t expect Apple to send back a letter specifically written for her, but frankly no letter would have been better than a cease and desist letter.

The impersonality and indifference of large corporations is often times quite irritating to me. I’m not even sure if good for people to be handled in such a robotic way. I understand the need for the impersonality with large corporations because they have to deal with so many people on a regular basis, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it.

If we go back 100-150 years, we see the beginning of large corporations, but at that time, the average person didn’t deal with them most of the time. If we go back 200 years, we find that large corporations as we know them today simply didn’t exist. If people wanted something, there was either a local store or manufacturer they could get it from or they made it on their own.

What do you think? What’s your opinion on large corporations?
