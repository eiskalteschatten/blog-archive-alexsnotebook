Well, Jake arrived in Bremen on Sunday and today I showed him around Oldenburg a bit. Tonight we also had a going away BBQ for Orion who leaves for the US for good tomorrow. It was a lot of fun. Rieke threw it at her apartment and her brother and his girlfriend were also there.

Tomorrow, Jake and I are off to Munich bright and early. The train we plan to catch leaves at 11:35 am, but we have to get up early to go to the grocery store for food for the trip and to catch the bus on time.

Iâ€™m bringing my computer, so I may have internet access at the hostels (most of them have free wireless access for people who bring their own computers). If I do, I may or may not write here, but I will at least be able to send and receive e-mail.
