[This](http://newsblaze.com/story/20090327170413zzzz.nb/topstory.html) is absolutely absurd! Led by Muslim nations, the United Nations has actually voted 23-11 in a vote “that urges member states to adopt laws outlawing criticism of religions.” What kind of smelly horse poop is that? How can the United Nations vote to restrict the criticism of religion? Does that mean I will go to jail for saying that Christianity is a mirage of meaning for the intellectually challenged? For saying that Islam is a hallucination of righteousness for the morally impaired?

Here is a portion of the article:

> Freedom House condemns the UN Human Rights Council for undermining the universal right to freedom of expression by once again passing a resolution that urges members to adopt laws outlawing criticism of religions.
> 
> The “defamation of religions” resolution, introduced by Pakistan on behalf of the Organization for the Islamic Conference (OIC), passed today by a vote of 23-11, with 13 abstentions. Muslim nations have been introducing similar resolutions since 1999, arguing that Islam-the only religion specifically cited in the text-must be shielded from unfair associations with terrorism and human rights abuses.
