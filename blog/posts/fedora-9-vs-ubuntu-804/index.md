PCWorld Australia has pitted Fedora 9 against Ubuntu 8.04 in an interesting article showing each one’s strengths and weaknesses. [PCWorld’s article](http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1631359451;pp;2;fp;16;fpid;1#content) concludes:

Robust security features and installation options make it somewhat more versatile than Ubuntu, which offers a more streamlined (and therefore more restricted) installation.
