I am excited to share a new project of mine that is very personal for me. I started a blog called *[The Beskirted Man](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/)* that is about promoting femininity in masculinity through clothing.

This project came around because I have been wearing skirts at home for several years now and I want to promote the idea that men can also wear skirts. They are comfortable, they are practical in a lot of ways and they just plain look good. So why shouldn’t men wear them too?

I wrote more extensively about my motivation for wearing them in the article [Why I Wear Skirts and Heels, or Why Showing Your Feminine Side Makes You More of a Man](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirts-and-dresses/why-i-wear-skirts-and-heels-or-why-showing-your-feminine-side-makes-you-more-of-a-man/).

Otherwise, you can read more about the project and what it’s supposed to achieve in the article [What is The Beskirted Man?](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/general/what-is-the-beskirted-man/).

I am, of course, always very interested in any feedback. Please let me know what you think either below in the comments or somewhere as a comment on the blog itself!
