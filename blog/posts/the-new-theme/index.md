Well, I can’t say I’m actually all that excited about the new theme, but it’s better than anything with idiotic flowers on it. Going through the themes offered by WordPress really tells me just how much I really really liked “Neat!” until they ruined it with flowers (see: [Ruined “Neat!” Theme](http://alexseifert.wordpress.com/2007/11/18/ruined-neato-theme/)).

I’m flat out angry about that. If I had an e-mail address or something for the creator, I would send them a nice e-mail about it.

RIP Neat!.
