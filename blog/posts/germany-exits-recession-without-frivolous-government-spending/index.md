The BBC is reporting that [Germany is exiting the recession](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8198766.stm) that has affected the entire world for the past couple of years. Germany, along with France, is one of the first countries to emerge from this economic downturn and yet [the German government did next to nothing to try to pull the country out of the recession](http://blog.mises.org/archives/010458.asp).

[An article in the Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123681293916501451.html) states the German stance on it:

> “Germany has the most capacity in Europe to increase spending, but Berlin has argued against running up big deficits…”
> 
> “Last year, according to the IMF, the U.S. pumped an extra 1.1% of GDP into the economy. Germany did next to nothing.”

I think the American government needs to take a page out of Germany’s book. For being a socialist country, Germany seems to have less government intervention in the economy than we do.
