For those of you who missed Korn’s performance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Korn has released a free streaming video of their performace of “Throw Me Away”. Although I’m not a huge fan of the whole “unplugged” thing, it’s actually quite impressive. They have Japanese drums and of course an orchestra backing them. I can’t say that “Throw Me Away” is my favorite song either, but I have to say that it actually may be better than the original…

Here’s a link to the video: [Throw Me Away](http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/virg001/korn/video/unplugged/korn_tonight_show_20070301.asx)
