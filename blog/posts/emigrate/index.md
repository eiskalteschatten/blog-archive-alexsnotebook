The past couple of days have been, well, boring at best.

Sunday, I did nothing really.

Yesterday, I was late to class because I had to pay my rent. The secretary here has extremely limited hours that don’t work whatsoever with my class. She’s only in from 9-12 in the morning Monday-Friday (excluding Wednesdays). My class is from 8 am – 2 pm. Then she also needed me to sign something else for the maintenance man. So she called him up to her office to have him inspect my room to make sure things are the way they should be (they will then use that signed list to make sure things are still the way they should be when I move out). Only he didn’t bring the form, so he said he would just meet me in my room. I went back up to my room to wait. 20 minutes later, he finally shows up again. He also said he’d get me my mailbox key, which I don’t have yet. He said he’d be right back with it. So I waited around for him to do that. An hour later, I decided that I really needed to be in class instead of waiting for him. So I left for class and haven’t seen him around since.

After class, I came back, then went downtown. I went to the electronics store there where I bought a CD that I couldn’t buy in the US. It’s by a band called Emigrate. For those of you who know the band Rammstein, it’s a side project of Rammstein’s lead guitarist, Richard. He sings in English instead of German though.

Anyway, then I went to McDonald’s and ate an early dinner. That’s the first time I’ve eaten out in quite a while. After that, I went to the bookstore and got a regular German dictionary (not an English-German dictionary, but rather a dictionary with German words defined by definitions in German) for the class I’m taking now. I also bought a novel in German which I haven’t started quite yet. On my way back to my bike, I ran into 2 other exchange students, a English girl and an Australian girl. They were doing some shopping as well.

When I got back, I then went to the grocery store and bought food. Exciting.

Not long after I got back from the grocery store, the exchange student from Syria, Nairouz (she’s from Syria, not France like I had thought she told me for some reason), came knocking at my door again. She needed some more help with her English homework. So I helped her. We finished it in about an hour, but she stayed around and just hung out for about 4 more hours. I think that’s the longest I’ve ever spoken German at once. It was really great practice. As I’ve been writing this today, she actually came by again today. She wanted to see if she could borrow my German-English dictionary. She also brought me some cookies that she made.

Today, I was on time to class. After class, I came back and wrote this. That’s all I’ve done today.
