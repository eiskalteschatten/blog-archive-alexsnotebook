I don’t really have much to write about, but I thought I would write something.

Today has been a nice today so far. It’s warm and sunny out, but it’s not hot yet. Today is really the first day I’ve been able to wear shorts comfortably which is really nice. On a less pleasant note, my computer is really beginning to crap out on me. I can’t even play music anymore without the songs skipping and that’s even without any other applications other than iTunes open.

Other than that, I don’t really have much to say, so I think that will do it for now.
