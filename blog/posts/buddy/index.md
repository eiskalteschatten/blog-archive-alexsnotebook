I want to start off by saying that I would really like to have a day that isn’t overcast so that I can go take some photos of the town for you. Now that I’ve mentioned that, I’ll move on.

Yesterday I didn’t do a whole lot. I went to class, then came back and watched the third part of *The Godfather* movies. I watched the first 2 movies the day before. They were actually a lot better than I had honestly expected. Then I went out with some of the exchange students and some German students to an Irish pub downtown. We were there until about 11:30 pm, then we all went home. I posted a couple of photos, but they are really bad quality since I didn’t have my camera and had to use my cell phone camera which doesn’t have a flash. The photos are [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/seifertalex/Parties).

Right before I left to go to the pub, I got an e-mail from Bob, my advisor here. Even though I never signed up for one, he went ahead and assigned me a German buddy. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it’s a program run by the university where German students sign up to help out international students and do things with them. They are also only allowed to speak to us in German, which means I’ll finally be getting some German practice. We’re going to be meeting up tomorrow during my lunch break at the cafeteria.
