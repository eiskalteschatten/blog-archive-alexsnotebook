My band, Asson, has finished two new songs. They are called “A New Start” and “Payment”. Again, we don’t have a vocalist, but the instrumental pieces are complete. In my opinion, the drums (played by me) are best in A New Start and the guitars are best in Payment. A New Start is faster more energetic and Payment isn’t slow, but slower, and has a lot more emotion to it.

If you would like to download them or just listen to them, you can find them here:

Any comments or feedback on them is greatly appreciated.
