  "excerpt": "My band, Asson, has finished two new songs. They are called &#8220;A New Start&#8221; and &#8220;Payment&#8221;. Again, we don&#8217;t have a vocalist, but the instrumental pieces are complete. In my opinion, the drums (played by me) are best in A New Start and the guitars are best in Payment. A New Start is faster more &#8230; more &#x2192;\n",
