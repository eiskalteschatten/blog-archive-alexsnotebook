Not only a good cocktail, but possibly the name of my next song. I have to admit that, although I’ve done it almost a couple hundred times already, it’s hard to come up with names for songs without lyrics. Some songs are easier than others, but for the most part, it’s hard. I will probably name the final version of the song something else, but for now the name *Sex on My Face* will have to do.

This song to me is interesting because it represents a combination of a new style I’m playing with and the old style found in my previous albums. In comparison to my usual style, this song is very simple and effective. There isn’t a lot going on and it doesn’t even change a whole lot. Hopefully you’ll like it.

I also seem to be having some sort of artistic block. I’m in the middle of the song and I just can’t seem to finish it in a way that satisfies my strict standards. This happens every so often and can last for weeks unfortunately. The good news is that it is usually followed by a spree of several completed songs in about a week’s or 2 weeks’ time. That means that hopefully once this block is over with, I’ll be able to finish my next album in a short amount of time. Of course, I’ll post my progress here as it goes.
