So here I am, sitting in my room, doing absolutely nothing. Today is the last day before the class for international students starts. I still have no idea where the laundry room is. I’ve looked all around and I’ve probably even opened doors I shouldn’t have and I still can’t find it. I can’t find anyone to ask either. I also still have no Internet. I’m not the only one getting frustrated with this guy. There have been several people that have moved in this week and also have no Internet because he’s not here. Every time I’ve got up there yesterday and today, there have been other people there wanting to talk to him about getting Internet. My guess is that he’s not here; which is really beginning to make me flat out mad.

Last night Nina, Kayla and I all met up again at the city fair. This time we went to a club downtown. It was called Civas, I think. It was fun, but we were there a lot later than I really wanted to be. I didn’t get back to my room until 5 in the morning. I also ended up walking back, which took about a half an hour. I posted some pictures of the fair I took with my new cell phone.

So I’ve pretty much sat around my room all day. I finished the book I was reading and am probably going to start the next one. I’ve been really busy everyday since I’ve got here, so one day to just sit around isn’t too bad. Later tonight, I’m going over to Nina’s to watch a movie and have some pizza. Kayla may or may not come. She was undecided last I talked to her. We’ll see.

Well, it turns out Kayla did come. We went rented the movie “The Good Shepherd”. It was an interesting movie especially in German.

So tomorrow the class for international students begins. It starts at 8:15 in the morning and I’m really not looking forward to getting up that early. We’ll see how it goes though.
