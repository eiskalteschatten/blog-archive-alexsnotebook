Well, I’m back from my time with Rolf and his family. I had a great time, but I’m also glad to be back home.

I will be writing more about it here soon. I’ll go into more details then. Until then, I’ve uploaded pictures from my trip which you can find here: [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/seifertalex/Christmas2007).
