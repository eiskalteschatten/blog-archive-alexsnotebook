Korn’s front man, Jonathan Davis, is going on an acoustic solo tour. I’m not entirely sure what exactly this entails, but you can find the tour dates on Korn’s official website [here](http://www.korn.com/site.php?content=tour&bandID=Jonathan).

The solo tour will be through the months of November and December. In January 2008, he will reunited with Korn for Korn’s next [major worldwide tour](http://www.korn.com/site.php?content=tour&bandID=Korn).

I honestly have no idea what to expect from it. I’m not sure if Jonathan’s voice is suitable for acoustic or not. We’ll see how it goes though.
