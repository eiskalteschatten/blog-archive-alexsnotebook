I’ve spent basically the entire day today cleaning. It has been a whole lot of fun. I cleaned our bathroom for the third time since moving in (I cleaned the shower for the first time since moving in), cleaned the kitchen for the second time, dusted for the second time and vacuumed for the second time. It was really dirty. While I was doing this though, my roommate sat there and did nothing which is really quite annoying. He didn’t even offer to help, despite him never having cleaned our bathroom or any bit of our apartment. At one point he fell asleep. That’s when I chose to vacuum.

I also picked up Kenneth’s old room so that Jake and Alex will be able to sleep in it when they arrive tomorrow. Louis’ friend who stays in that room occasionally had really trashed it out. I didn’t realize beer molded, but it does. It’s airing out right now because it really stunk. Jake and Alex fly in tomorrow and Jake’s mom is going to pick them up. We’re going to meet half way between here and the airport, then I’m going to drive them the rest of the way back here.

I’m really looking forward to tomorrow. I’ve got 2 classes, then my spring break starts. And of course Jake and Alex will be here.
