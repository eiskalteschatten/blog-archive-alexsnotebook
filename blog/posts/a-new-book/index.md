I can’t say that I’ve done a whole lot recently, so this post will be fairly short. I just figured I should update everyone as to what’s going on here.

Last Saturday I went and watched a soccer game at one of the bars in the downtown area. I went with another American.

Today I finished the book I’ve been reading and started the next one.

That’s everything that’s going on. I’ve mostly just been spending my time reading, playing computer games, playing bass and listening to music. I’ve also gone on walks everyday just to go outside and so that I don’t spend all my time in my room sitting.

I know when I get back to the US, I will be dropping my Russian major — mostly because of lack of interest. Instead I’ve been considering picking up a history major. I figure this will add another year to my college career, but that would put me at the normal 4 years anyway since I was a year ahead when I started. We’ll see how it goes though.
