Reuters is reporting [a very strange story](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=97627&videoChannel=4) about an Indian girl who married a dog apparently to ward off spirits or something. Here is what Reuters has to say about it:

> Jan 26 – In India’s eastern Jharkhand, villagers ‘married’ off a young girl to a stray dog to ward off an evil spirit.
> 
> The locals at Munda Dhanda village performed the ceremony as they believe it will overcome any curse that might fall on the family.
> 
> Interestingly, the girl is free to get married later in life to a man without even seeking a divorce.  
> Superstitions are widespread in India, especially in rural areas where literacy is scarce.
