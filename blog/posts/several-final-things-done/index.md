Well, yesterday I sold my bike and took care of getting everything signed that I need signed to get credit back in Wyoming. I don’t think I actually have a reason to go back to the university at all anymore, although I probably still will to show Jake when he gets here on Sunday.

Today I went to the bank and closed my account. For some reason, June’s rent was refunded and July’s rent was never taken out. I’m not sure why that was, so I’m going to just keep the money and see about it when I have my final appointment with the secretary. I’ve also done quite a bit of cleaning today.

Dieuwertje was over again last night and will be here again in an hour. It will be the last time we get to hang out because tomorrow she’s going home for good. Her family is coming here to help her move and drive her and her stuff home. Apparently it’s only an hour drive from here to there. I’m also going to be helping her move, so I’ll meet her family which should be fun.

On Saturday, I’m going to just do a lot of cleaning and other final things that I need to finish before I leave. I still have to do laundry one last time and I need to clean my room really well so that it’s done before Jake gets here.
