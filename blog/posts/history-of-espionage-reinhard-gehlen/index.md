For one of my history classes this semester, I am going to be doing a semi-lengthy paper on Reinhard Gehlen. This class is a historical methods class, however the focus of the class is the history of espionage. I was assigned the topic of Reinhard Gehlen because I can read German primary sources without the need to translate.

Reinhard Gehlen in 1945

For those of you who have no idea who Reinhard Gehlen is, he was the a major-general in the German army during World War II. After the war, he was recruited along with several other high-ranking Nazi officials by the CIA to setup an spy ring directed against the Soviet Union. He is essentially considered the founder of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) which is more or less the German equivalent of the CIA.
