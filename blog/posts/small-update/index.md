I’m currently working on a small update for ScratchPad which will probably be version 1.4.1. This version will not a whole lot of new things included, but it will be necessary in anticipation of Apple’s release of Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) this summer. The new version will be signed with Apple so that it will fit into the new Gatekeeper security scheme in Mountain Lion. That will be the only major difference. Another small feature I will include is the ability to make ScratchPad take advantage of Lion’s fullscreen ability for those who want to use it.

In other ScratchPad news, I am also already at work on the next version of ScratchPad which will contain several new features which have been requested for quite some time. I will make another announcement when I have a better idea of the complete feature set.
