A friend of mine sent me a bunch of [interesting photos](http://www.funtasticus.com/20090204/amusing-photography-ads/) by photographer Jean Yves Lemuan. Some of them are really quite interesting. The group of photos that stood out to me consists of these:

[![Graffiti](https://i0.wp.com/www.undesregnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/interesting-photos-2354-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202 "Graffiti")](http://www.undesregnet.com/2009/02/05/interesting-photos/interesting-photos-2354/)

[![Molotov Cocktail](https://i0.wp.com/www.undesregnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/interesting-photos-2454-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202 "Blackness Molotov Cocktail")](http://www.undesregnet.com/2009/02/05/interesting-photos/interesting-photos-2454/)

Molotov Cocktail

  

[![Nazi Salute](https://i0.wp.com/www.undesregnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/interesting-photos-2554-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202 "Blackness Nazi Salute")](http://www.undesregnet.com/2009/02/05/interesting-photos/interesting-photos-2554/)

[![Ignoring Poverty](https://i0.wp.com/www.undesregnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/interesting-photos-2654-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202 "Blackness Ignoring Poverty")](http://www.undesregnet.com/2009/02/05/interesting-photos/interesting-photos-2654/)

Ignoring Poverty

The whole point of the series it seems to me is a visualization of the blackness that drives people to do things such as graffiti or giving the Nazi-salute. The one that really stood out in the series for me though was this one:

[![Praying](https://i0.wp.com/www.undesregnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/interesting-photos-2254-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202 "Blackness Praying")](http://www.undesregnet.com/2009/02/05/interesting-photos/interesting-photos-2254/)

Praying

The photographer here is portraying that the same blackness the drives people to give the Nazi salute or to throw a Molotov cocktail or to spray paint graffiti or to ignore poverty, drives people to pray and to religion in general. I really like Jean Yves Lemuanâ€™s portrayal of that concept.
