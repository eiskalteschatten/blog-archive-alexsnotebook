My next album, Parlour, is getting closer and closer to completion. So far the album has 14 and a half tracks. The 15th track is still not complete, but it’s getting very close.

The album artwork has been decided on for Parlour. I incorporated the help of a friend of mine because I didn’t even have the slightest clue as to what I wanted the album cover to look like. You can see it here:
