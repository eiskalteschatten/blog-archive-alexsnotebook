\[digg=http://www.digg.com/software/A\_Nice\_Little\_App\]I found a nice little application today that I think I will be using for quite some time. It’s an application for Mac OS X called **Cashbox**.

Cashbox is a financial management program that has no frills. My favorite part of Cashbox is that it only does the basic functions that most people need. You could almost consider it a replacement for the paper log found in checkbooks, but with automatic adding and subtracting and graphs. It also allows you to keep track of more than one bank account and make transfers between them. You can also add labels to each transaction, which it uses to generate graphs. For example, you can have a “Food Expenses” label or a “Gas” label. If you had both of these, you can view a pie-graph that will show you what percentage of your budget goes to food expenses and what percentage goes to gas.

Other than that, it doesn’t really do much else. It’s simplicity is really nice and is also compensated by the fact that it’s freeware. You can make donations if you would like, but no payment is required to use it.

Now that I’ve told you about it, I’ll give you a link so you can go download it. Here it is: [http://www.fadingred.org/cashbox](http://www.fadingred.org/cashbox)
