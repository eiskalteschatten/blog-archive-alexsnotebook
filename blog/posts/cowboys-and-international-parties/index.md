Well, not much going on here. Yesterday there was an international festival at the university. Several stands were setup that represented various countries. The stands were generally fun by exchange students and international students from the respective countries and they were selling souvenirs and food from their countries. It was a fun time. I mostly hung out with Dieuwertje and for some reason we pretty much stayed at the Australian stand. I’m not sure why. At some point I was wearing a hat that looks like the Australian flag ([see picture](http://picasaweb.google.com/seifertalex/MiscGermany/photo#5208540531080210610)). Several Germans came up wanting to get pictures with me. They thought I was from Australia.

Today I had to give a presentation in my Working, Speaking and Presenting class. It was on cowboys. The presentation didn’t go as well I had hoped though because I guess I freeze when I get up in front of a crowd like that. I knew the material pretty well and had more than enough for the time I had to present (30 minutes), but the problem was that because I was nervous my grammar was absolutely horrible and I probably sounded like I didn’t belong in such a high level German class. Oh well.
