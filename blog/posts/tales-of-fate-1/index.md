There I sat. In the darkness. Alone. My child had just died and I sat near his grave. I lifted my head and looked at the stars. There was a light breeze which I could feel in my hair. The sky was clear and all of the stars were bright and wonderful. They were so beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous.

On the child’s grave, the words

“Here lays a child,  
that only wanted to live.  
One can assume  
that he should have prayed more.”

were written. When you read these at this place, you can feel the tears of the child. But the stars were so beautiful.

The breeze got stronger and a shabby tree caught my attention. I could hear a melody in the wind which I used to play for my child when I put him to bed. I began to smell a rotten smell rising from the ground. I shuttered.

Next to the tree I could see something. It was white, but not very bright in the dark graveyard. It stood there. It looked at me. I looked up. The stars were so beautiful.
