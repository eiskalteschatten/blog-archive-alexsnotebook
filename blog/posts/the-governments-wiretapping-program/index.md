I can’t say that I am a big fan of the wiretapping program. I agree with the American Civil Liberties Union in that it seems to me to be a violation of our privacy.

The good news however, is:

> “Unaffected, however, are the suits that have been brought against telecom firms alleged to have cooperated in the NSA program—suits the White House is seeking to block by a legislative grant of retroactive immunity, which stalled in the House of Representatives last week.” *(Source: [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080220-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-nsa-wiretap-case.html))*

I believe that the telecom companies that participated in the illegal wiretapping program should not be protected. They should be brought to trial and forced to make compensations. If for no other reason than to set an example that companies should not participate in illegal programs on behalf of anyone — including the government.
