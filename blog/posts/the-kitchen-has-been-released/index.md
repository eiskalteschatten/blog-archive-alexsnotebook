Today The Kitchen has finally been released! There are a large number of tracks on the album, which means I have decided to split it into two different volumes. As part of a new plan I have for my music, I am also going to be releasing it as a free download from [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Seifert/). More information about that project will come later. Until then, enjoy The Kitchen!

You can listen to it and download it for free here:
