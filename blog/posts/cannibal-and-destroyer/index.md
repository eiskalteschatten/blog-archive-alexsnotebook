Has anyone heard the new singles from Static-X?

If you haven’t, they’re called Cannibal and Destroyer.

Honestly, I’d have to say they kick ass. It’s definitely Static-X, but at the same time, it’s a new style for them I think. If you haven’t heard them yet, click on the links below to listen to them in iTunes:
