I am getting ridiculously sick of having to deal with this whole transfer process. I was told I needed to submit a transcript from the University of Oldenburg to the Office of Admissions at the University of North Dakota, but the problem is that they do not do transcripts. The Office of Admissions apparently does not understand this. I called them today and was forwarded to a number of different people before I was finally forwarded to the Director of Admissions. Unfortunately she was in a meeting, so I had to leave a message. My call was never returned which frustrates me, so I will have to call tomorrow.

I also got an e-mail from the guy who is responsible for transfer students. He told me that I still need to fill out and send in a Safety and Security form that should accompany the application. The problem is that I have already done this twice now. The way I see it, there are 3 things possible: Iâ€™ve sent it to the wrong address each time, the post office has lost each of them or UND has lost them. The latter seems to be the most likely considering I copied the address *verbatim* from the letter they sent me in which they told me the address to send it to.
