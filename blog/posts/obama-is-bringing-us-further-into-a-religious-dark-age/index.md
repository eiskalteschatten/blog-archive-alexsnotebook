According to the [White House Blog](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/working_with_faith/):

> “Instead of driving us apart, our very beliefs can bring us together,” President Obama said yesterday at the National Prayer Breakfast.
> 
> E pluribus unum, in other words.
> 
> After the breakfast he announced an executive order establishing the new White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, and talked about the role faith-based and secular community organizations will play in our economic recovery.
> 
> “People trust them. Communities rely on them. And we will help them,” he said.
> 
> The President named Joshua DuBois to lead the office, and also announced the creation of the President’s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships — a group of 25 religious and secular leaders, listed below.
> 
> “Whether it’s connecting groups that are training people to do new jobs, or figuring out the role of faith-based organizations in combating global climate change, this office creates those partnerships in a way that’s responsible, constitutional, and — bottom line — helps those in need,” DuBois said.

“An executive order establishing the new White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, and talked about the role faith-based and secular community organizations will play in our economic recovery.” What is that?!?! Last time I checked the constitution, religion was supposed to be entirely separate from the government.

Obama said that “instead of driving us apart, our very beliefs can bring us together,” but the problem is that *their* beliefs and *their* insistance on religion does not bring us together. On the contrary, it drives us apart because those of us who do not subscribe to the old dogmas of fictitious supernatural beings controlling every aspect of the universe are suddenly given the cold shoulder by the American government. Quite the opposite to “bringing us together” I would say.
