Earlier today, I posted an article about Korn’s MTV Unplugged special.

Well, what I didn’t realize that Korn had already put an announcement on their website about the Unplugged album. It doesn’t look like it will be the new album due to come out this summer. According to Korn’s website, the Unplugged album will be due in stores on March 6, 2007.
