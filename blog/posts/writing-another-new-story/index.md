I’ve been working on another story now for the past couple of weeks and I really like the way it’s turning out. So far it’s shaping up to be the best story I have ever written I think (pardon my self-gloating).

My favorite part about writing stories is that, even as the author, most of the time you don’t really know which direction it’s going to take next. Of course I have a final goal and I have stages that the characters pass through to finally achieve that goal, but it’s *how* the characters go through those stages is what is most interesting and often times sporadic. The story can sometimes sidetrack from the main path to the goal only to take a different path to the same goal.

For me, it seems, that writing a story is generally about as good as reading one. While reading is of course much more passive than writing, the images that come flowing through my head as I’m writing are just as vivid and interesting as those I get when reading a story.

Anyway, the new story is called *An Amalgamation of People* and I guess could be considered to be a horror story, although I don’t really think it’s particularly scary. I will post it here when I finish. Check back then!
