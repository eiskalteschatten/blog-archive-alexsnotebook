Nine Inch Nails have announced their new single, “Survivalism”. According to their website, it’s playing on radio stations nationwide and will available in the iTunes Music Store soon. If you can’t wait until then, you can also listen to it on the Nine Inch Nails MySpace site here: [http://www.myspace.com/nin](http://www.myspace.com/nin).

The CD single will be released in Europe on March 5th.

After listening to the single on MySpace, I’d have to say that it’s typically Nine Inch Nails. It reminds me a lot of their song “The Hand That Feeds”.

This brings me to another announcement about Nine Inch Nails. Their new album, **Year Zero**, is due out on April 17, 2007. The tracklisting is as follows:

“Hyperpower!”
