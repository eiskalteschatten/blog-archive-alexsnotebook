[Luca Bramè](https://thelibre.news/no-really-dont-use-brave/) at LibreNews writes about why he would recommend against using the Brave Browser despite it being known for protecting its users’ privacy:

> If you are keen on personal privacy, you might have come across Brave Browser. Brave is a Chromium-based browser that promises to deliver privacy with built-in ad-blocking and content-blocking protection. It also offers several quality-of-life features and services, like a VPN and Tor access. I mean, it’s even listed on the reputable PrivacyTools website. Why am I telling you to steer clear of this browser, then?

I’ve chosen to include the first and the last paragraphs of the article because they do a great job summarizing it. In essence, Brave might be known for being a browser that protects its users’ privacy, but some of the practices the company behind it (and its founder and CEO) have engaged in are questionable at best. At worst, they harm user privacy rather than help it.

I won’t go into all the details of each controversy because Luca does an excellent job with that. I can highly recommend that you read the full article for all of the juicy details. What I will say, though, is that I agree with him fully. I experimented with Brave for a while but ultimately decided to give it up because of all the shady practices. They just didn’t sit right with me.

Browsers are such a fundamental piece of software in our modern lives and even more so for me as a web developer. I need one I can trust, and Brave is most certainly not that one.
