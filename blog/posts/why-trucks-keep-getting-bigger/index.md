I’ve noticed this trend. Every time I go back to the US, it feels like the trucks have grown again. If you compare, for example, a 1995 Ford F-250 to a 2025 F-250, the new model dwarfs the 30 year old model. I’ve always wondered why and this video explains it pretty well in an entertaining way.

The only issue I take with the video is that they are comparing a modern Chevy 2500 HD pickup to a 80s Toyota Pickup. Those vehicles are in different size classes which makes the comparison biased. It would have been better to compare a modern Chevy 2500 HD to an 80s Chevy C-10 3/4 ton or a modern Tacoma with its 80s ancestor. They would have at least stayed in the same size class then.
