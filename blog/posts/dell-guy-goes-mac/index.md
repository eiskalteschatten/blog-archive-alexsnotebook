I went to a party on Saturday night and one of the guys who was there brought his computer. It was a brand new MacBook and the first one I’ve seen since Apple came out with their new line of MacBook and MacBook Pros on October 14th. I got to talking with him about it and quickly realized he wasn’t just some guy that follows the trend or buys technology-related items because that’s what the guy next to him bought. He knew what he was talking about in terms of computers.

After talking with him for a while, he mentioned that he just made the switch to Mac and that his MacBook was the first Mac he has ever owned. He also mentioned that he’s worked for Dell for a while, but that he had had enough of the problems attributed to Windows, so he decided to opt for a Mac. Based one what he has experienced so far with his Mac, he said that he will never go back to Windows again after getting used to the Mac.
