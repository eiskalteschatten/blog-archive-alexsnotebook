I finally did something! Yesterday I went to a surprise birthday party for Kayla. Her actual birthday is March 5th, but because her parents and grandmother are here and they’re traveling around Europe together, we had a party for her last night. It was a lot of fun until the end when one of the other Americans got so drunk that he fell, hit his head on the floor and then had a huge gash above his eye. We decided to take him to the hospital because it wouldn’t stop bleeding and it looked like he was going to need stitches and also after we realized that he had been drinking wine mixed with some strong liqueur. He also stopped responding to us when we would ask him something.

On a lighter note, I uploaded a few pictures from the party [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/seifertalex/Parties).
