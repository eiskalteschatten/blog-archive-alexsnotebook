So, after some thought about my blog consolidation problems, I have decided to change Alex’s Thoughts entirely around. I now have a new theme that corresponds better to my German blog, [Es Wird Kalt](http://www.eswirdkalt.com) and a new name for Alex’s Thoughts, which is Und Es Regnet. “Und es regnet” means “and it’s raining” in German. The reason I chose this is two fold. First of all, I already had the domain which was just sitting stagnant. Secondly, I’ve decided to go with a different theme for this blog.

Whereas it used to be focused more upon technology and politics, I am going to change that focus to more of the world from a student of German’s perspective. So I will be complaining or praising or reviewing things that have more to do with the German language, culture, history, politics, etc. I will still post things of interest that have to do with technology and what not, but the focus is really going to be on things that are German-related. Thus the correlation with my German blog, [Es Wird Kalt](http://www.eswirdkalt.com).

Because of the change in theme, there will also be some reorganizing with categories. I will continue doing history posts with [History Rhymes](http://www.historyrhymes.info) and commentary about American politics on [Despotic Democracy](http://despoticdemocracy.wordpress.com).
