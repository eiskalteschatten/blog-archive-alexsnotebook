I know it’s been a while since anyone has posted anything, but here goes the first post in about five months.

The day Emigrate’s new self-titled album was released here in Germany, I rushed to the store to purchase it. I have to admit that, although I had already heard the songs Emigrate made available through their website and newsletter, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. I put the new CD in my computer and started playing it. After listening to the entire CD, admittedly I wasn’t actually all that impressed. I was even somewhat disappointed. However, I decided to rip it from the CD and put it on my iPod all the same. After listening to some of the songs a few more times, I really grew to like them a lot.

The songs all have a trace of Rammstein in them, but they certainly are not Rammstein songs. Unlike Rammstein, the vocals are not low and rumbling, but rather fairly high and melodic; and of course they are in English instead of German. The only song I would say bears a direct resemblance to a Rammstein song would be “Let Me Break”. The guitar piece in the chorus sounds suspiciously close to the guitar piece in the song “Stein um Stein” on Rammstein’s Reise Reise album.

Overall though, I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Rammstein or similar bands.
