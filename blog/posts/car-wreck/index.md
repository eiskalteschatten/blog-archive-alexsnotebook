Last Friday (the 13th), my 1987 Toyota LandCruiser was broadsided by a 2007 Ford F-350. My truck is totaled, but fortunately I wasn’t injured. I was driving down a road and the driver of the F-350 neglected to stop at a stop sign and just plowed right into me. He was leaving a parking lot and literally just didn’t stop at the stop sign which was at the exit of the parking lot.
