I am the proud owner of 4 domain names: [www.alexseifert.com](http://www.alexseifert.com), [www.wideopenart.com](http://www.wideopenart.com), [www.eswirdkalt.com](http://www.eswirdkalt.com) and [www.undesregnet.com](http://www.undesregnet.com). As such, I have been trying to figure out what to do with the latter 3. I use alexseifert.com as my general internet-base for things such as this blog and my other blogs as well as for my music. Wideopenart.com used to be a website that I kept that displayed online galleries of art done by myself and several other friends. Eswirdkalt.com used to be a fansite for the German band, [Eisbrecher](http://www.eis-brecher.com) and undesregnet.com used to be a fansite for another German band, [Der Bote](http://www.der-bote.com). The sites went down quite some time ago when the Windows 2000-based server I owned and co-hosted at my ISP became too infected with viruses and other malware to work properly.

Since then I have decided I have no interest in having and maintaining my own server and therefore have signed up for a hosting service. While I have gotten alexseifert.com back up and running, the other domains I am no longer sure what to do with. I am thinking I am going to use wideopenart.com as kind of an online portfolio for my photography, webdesigns, digital artwork, stories, etc, but as far as the other 2 domains go, I am not sure what to do with them. I no longer have the time (or desire) to keep fansites.

I am considering maybe using one of them (possibly eswirdkalt.com) as a blog that I will keep in German, however I am not sure what I would blog about nor am I sure if I would have the time. I barely have enough time to blog here and at [History Rhymes](http://historyrhymes.alexseifert.com) (in fact, Iâ€™m really far behind at History Rhymes).

Does anyone have any suggestions?
