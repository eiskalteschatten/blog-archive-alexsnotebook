Yesterday I was finally able to order a brand new MacBook. Iâ€™m quite excited about it because it means I can finally rid myself of the stupid PC laptop with Windows Vista that I have been using now for a while. I hate that thing. Vista is slow, sloppy, ugly, unreliable and generally obnoxious to work with.
