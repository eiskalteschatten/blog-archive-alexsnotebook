I have been hard at work on the new site for a while now. It is shaping up really nicely and I am extremely excited to release it. The artwork is fantastic and the design itself is a huge improvement over the last version. I have also finally added a new domain name specifically for my music: [https://www.alexseifertmusic.com](https://www.alexseifertmusic.com). The old [http://music.alexseifert.com](http://music.alexseifert.com) is still accessible, but it simply points to the new site.

On a different note, while the site is being finished, I have begun compiling songs for a greatest hits album. I have already commissioned the artwork for the album and now it is just a matter of coming up with a list of songs to add to the album. Does anyone have any favorites/suggestions? If so, please leave them in the comments below!
