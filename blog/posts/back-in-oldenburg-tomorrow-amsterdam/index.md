Well, I’m back in Oldenburg now after a 10 hour train ride from Vienna. I probably really won’t post anything more here as I don’t think I will really have internet access starting tomorrow until I get home.

Tomorrow I check out of my room here in Oldenburg then Jake and I are off to Amsterdam for the day. Early Wednesday morning, we fly home and that will conclude my year-long trip here.
