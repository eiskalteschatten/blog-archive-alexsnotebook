\[digg=http://www.digg.com/design/Ruined\_Neat\_Theme\]Whoever makes the theme called “Neat!” on WordPress, which I have used for this blog for so long, has just ruined it entirely. They have added really stupid looking flowers to the sidebar (see below).

I think I’m going to change themes now because of it. I figure a mostly tech blog doesn’t need flowers to adorn it. Somehow that just doesn’t seem to fit…

It’s really too bad because I really like the “Neat!” theme. I just can’t stand the stupid looking flowers. They had to ruin it by adding something so simple and so stupid.

RIP Neat!.
