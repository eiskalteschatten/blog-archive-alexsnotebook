Some miscellaneous Mark Twain quotes that I found amusing:

> “Whenever I feel the urge to exercise I lie down until it goes away”

> “Familiarity breeds contempt — and children”

> “The past does not repeat itself, but it rhymes”

> “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.”

> “None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth.”
