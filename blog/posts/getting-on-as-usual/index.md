Well, there really isn’t a whole lot going on at the moment. I’ve been hard at work on both Xynx’s debut album album as well as the my next album. I’ve also been helping write some material and producing some songs for a band called Tea & Bricks which I will talk about in a future post. For now, I’ll just tell you that they are a rock band that has some pretty decent stuff.

Unfortunately, the free download for Parlour is still down and may be down for a while yet. I’m not quite sure what’s going on with it, but as usual I will let you know here when I find out more details about it.
