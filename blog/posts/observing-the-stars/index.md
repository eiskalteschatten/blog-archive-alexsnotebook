Tonight I signed up to be one of only a few people in the class who will get to go on top of the Physical Science building and observe the night sky through the university’s telescopes up there. I’m actually pretty excited about it. Our astronomy teacher who is a graduate student is going to be taking us up there and showing us various constellations, stars, comets and nebulae of interest. We also get extra credit for it, although I probably would go whether or not we got extra credit because it is probably the only real chance I will ever have to look through powerful telescopes at objects in the night sky.

The only thing that will ruin the night is if it continues to be overcast and we can’t observe anything because of the clouds. It has been quite warm all day today (in the 60’s), but this afternoon clouds have moved in and it looks as though they are threatening to rain upon us. I guess we’ll see how it goes tonight though.
