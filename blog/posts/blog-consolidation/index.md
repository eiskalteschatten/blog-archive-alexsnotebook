My WordPress.com Blog

I have come to the conclusion that I have far too many blogs. At the moment I have 15 different blogs registered with WordPress.com. Most of them are old and I have long since taken out of public view. There are, however, 2 that are registered with WordPress.com that are used for news ([AlexSeifert.com](http://www.alexseifert.com/news) and [ScratchPad](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com)) and one that was used as a public journal during my time studying abroad in Germany which I no longer update since I am no longer in Germany, but that still leaves me 4 that are used for generic blogs. I consistently update them, but I am considering consolidating them.

These blogs are [Despotic Democracy](http://despoticdemocracy.wordpress.com), [Alex’s Thoughts](http://thoughts.alexseifert.com), [History Rhymes](http://www.historyrhymes.info) and [Es Wird Kalt](http://www.eswirdkalt.com).

Each blog serves its own purpose. [Despotic Democracy](http://despoticdemocracy.wordpress.com) critically discusses American politics with a conservative biased. [History Rhymes](http://www.historyrhymes.info) is a blog dedicated to my infatuation with the history of the American West. Then both [Es Wird Kalt](http://www.eswirdkalt.com) and [Alex’s Thoughts](http://thoughts.alexseifert.com) are more generic blogs where I post various things that come up of interest or rants about whatever I find obnoxious. The former is in German and the latter, in English.

I know that each blog has a very specific purpose, but given my subscriber base, I don’t really know if it is work the upkeep of the 4 separate blogs. The real problem I face with updating 4 blogs is that, although I consistently update them, it appears that I don’t update them all that often because the updates are spread across all 4 of them. That means, that while I have 12 posts on this blog for the month of January (as of this writing), I actually have more like 30 or 40 posts across all of the blogs for this month.

I don’t know what to do. If I were to consolidate them, that would mean that users who are only interested in one area would then have to sift through all of the uninteresting posts. Not to mention I would really have to keep the German and English blogs separate because I don’t think a bilingual blog is probably a good idea unless the blog is designed as an aide for learning one language or the other.

What do you think I should do?
