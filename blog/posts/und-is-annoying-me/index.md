The University of North Dakota is starting to get on my nerves. The application process is taking an amazingly long time because they continually insist on sending me things via snail-mail. I just got a form from them today that my parents had to forward me since UND sends the snail-mail to my parentsâ€™ address. On top of the length of time it takes to actually send and receive these things, this form they just sent me I have already filled out and sent them once before. Now I have to do it again for no particular reason it seems. They must have lost it the first time. Hopefully this will be the last thing I have to send them.
