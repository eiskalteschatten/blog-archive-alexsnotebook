We all know about the timeless war waged between the two largest consumer computing behemoths in the world. It’s the classic problem of Mac vs PC. In recent years, Apple has been able to regain ground lost to Microsoft in the mid-ninties and has proven that they seriously mean business.

Why is this? Earlier today I was reading an interesting article comparing Apple announcing new products at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco and Microsoft announcing new products at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The article gives a timeline of what each company talked about every year since 2000.

I won’t repeat everything that is written in the article I read, instead I’ll just give you a link: [http://www.roughlydrafted.com](http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/F32D77B6-BD60-43A2-8C4B-E7F46929D116.html)

I will, however, give you a basic overview of what is discussed there, as it is quite a long read. Basically, when Microsoft announces a new product or a new service at CES, it doesn’t always deliver. Apple, on the other hand, delivers what it promises. Apple also has a tendency to discuss and to say what the consumers want to hear, whereas Microsoft has a tendency to talk less about what consumers want to hear. It also briefly discusses Microsoft’s all-to-often-failed ventures into consumer electronics and it’s failures at having successful partnerships.

To sum it all up, I leave you with a quote from the article: “With partners like Microsoft, who need enemies?”
