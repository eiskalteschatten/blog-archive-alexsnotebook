I really love the German language. I love it to the point that I use it all the time. I do, however, really just like to use English on occasion without any German. That mood, for lack of a better word, seems to come and go in phases. When I am more inclined to use English, I generally tend to read more books and write more on my blogs than when I am in the mood for German. Although now with [my German blog](http://www.eswirdkalt.com), I have the ability to also write when I am in the mood for German as well.

At the moment, I really just want to speak English. And therefore I have been reading a lot more and writing a lot more blog posts. This phase will probably last a week or two and then I will be back in my German phase. I have no idea why I go back and forth so much, but it seems to happen all the time.
