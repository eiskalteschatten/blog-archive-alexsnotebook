[As I mentioned a couple of days ago](http://manifestlyabsurd.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/hiking-on-sunday/), I have plans to go hiking with Lizz on Sunday. The forecast said it was going to be nice out all weekend long and that we would even have warm temperatures both Saturday and Sunday. Well, the weather seems to have taken a turn for the worst. Yesterday was cold and extremely windy. Today it’s overcast and cold again. The forecast is now predicting that we will have snow Saturday which means hiking on Sunday may need to be cancelled.

I suppose we’ll have to just wait and see how much snow we get if we actually get any at all. The forecast has predicted snow several times in the past and usually it is wrong. Hopefully that’s the case for Saturday. Sunday is supposed to be cold, but sunny outside, so if we don’t get a lot of snow (or any) on Saturday, then I say the hiking trip is probably still on. Let’s just hope that’s the case.
