It seems like every browser is currently jumping on the band wagon and trying to “enhance” the browsing experience with generative AI and, frankly, it’s getting annoying. As I have stated in [previous posts](https://blog.alexseifert.com/2025/08/23/why-is-there-so-much-bragging-about-ai-taking-jobs/), I am not against AI and use it quite frequently to augment my work as a developer, to check for grammar mistakes in my writing, and to generate images for my blogs.

However, I am starting to experience a sort of “AI fatigue” in that I am really getting tired of the hype and especially of it being shoved down my throat in a new way every time I get on one of my devices. The fact that it is showing up everywhere even if it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense means that every time I see “ChatGPT” or “Copilot” or “Gemini,” I feel like vomiting. In my opinion, they’re ruining their own branding by over-using it in absolutely everything.

I am aware that the way I am writing about it makes me sound closed-minded towards AI. That isn’t because I am unwilling to give it a shot, it’s because I’ve become burnt out on the hype. I have always approached AI and other new features with an open mind since I enjoy experimenting and playing around with new technologies, but the need to infuse absolutely *everything* with it is getting to be quite ridiculous. Even Notepad, yes, *Notepad* now has Copilot.

Browsers have not been excluded from this dilution of the AI experience. Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari have all gained AI features that I have experimented with, but find utterly useless. Mostly, they just distract from the browsing experience rather than enhance it.

The only feature I’ve found even remotely useful has been Safari’s integration of Apple’s [Writing Tools](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/find-the-right-words-with-writing-tools-mchldcd6c260/mac) which is available systemwide on macOS, iOS and iPadOS and is like a souped-up spelling and grammar check. Other features, such as article summarizations, I just don’t trust. They’ve been known to hallucinate and summarize incorrectly which defeats the entire point of their existence. Not only that, but if I’m going to read an article, I’m going to read it and not just a summary. AI-generated summaries feel a little like they only cater to the growing [attention span problem induced by social media](https://www.clrn.org/how-does-social-media-affect-attention-span/).

But I digress. There is still hope for those who want to escape the AI mess in their browsers. Yesterday, Vivaldi’s founder and CEO Jon von Tetzchner released [a blog post on their official blog](https://vivaldi.com/blog/keep-exploring/) declaring that the Vivaldi browser will stay AI-free.

*Note: I am not sponsored by Vivaldi — or anyone else for that matter.*

Here’s part of what he wrote:

> Across the industry, artificial assistants are being embedded directly into browsers, and pitched as a quicker path to answers. Google is bringing Gemini into Chrome to summarize pages and, in future, work across tabs and navigate sites on a user’s behalf. Microsoft is promoting Edge as an AI browser, including new modes that scan what is on screen and anticipate actions.
> 
> These moves are reshaping the address bar into an assistant prompt, turning the joy of exploring into inactive spectatorship.
> 
> This shift has major consequences for the web as we know it. Independent research shows users are less likely to click through to original sources when an AI summary is present, which means fewer visits for publishers, creators, and communities that keep the web vibrant. A recent study by [PewResearch](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) found users clicked traditional results roughly half as often when AI summaries appeared. [Publishers warn](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/googles-ai-overviews-hit-by-eu-antitrust-complaint-independent-publishers-2025-07-04/) of dramatic traffic losses when AI overviews sit above links.

> The stakes are high. New AI-native browsers and agent platforms are arriving, while regulators debate remedies that could reshape how people reach information online. The next phase of the browser wars is not about tab speed, it is about who intermediates knowledge, who benefits from attention, who controls the pathway to information, and who gets to monetize you.\[…\]

> Vivaldi is the haven for people who still want to explore. We will continue building a browser for curious minds, power users, researchers, and anyone who values autonomy. If AI contributes to that goal without stealing intellectual property, compromising privacy or the open web, we will use it. If it turns people into passive consumers, we will not.
> 
> We will stay true to our identity, giving users control and enabling  people to use the browser in combination with whatever tools they want to use. Our focus is on building a powerful personal and private browser for you to explore the web on your own terms. We will not turn exploration into passive consumption.

I’m glad that at least one browser is taking a stand against the AI enshittification taking place elsewhere. Again, I am not against AI, I’m just against the hype and companies trying to ram it down our throats at every single opportunity whether it actually makes sense or not. It just feels like they’re trying to justify their enormous multi-billion dollar investments before the [bubble bursts](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/nvidia-results-ai-artificial-intelligence-b2815982.html) by cramming it in absolutely everything.

This post was originally going to be a simple post saying, “Hey! Look! Vivaldi has taken a stance against adding AI to their browser!” but has since transformed into a rant about all of the hype surrounding AI. I would apologize for it, but I’m not going to because I think it’s important to push back a little bit against it.
