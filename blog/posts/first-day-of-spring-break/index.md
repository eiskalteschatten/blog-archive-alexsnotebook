My spring break has officially begun. I had my last class (astronomy) at 1 and it ended at 2. Now I’m free for the next week and I can hardly wait. I really need a break.

At the moment I’m sitting around waiting for a phone call from Jake which I expect in about an hour or so. Jake and Alex are on the plane right now and land in about an hour. Jake is supposed to call me once he lands. Then I will start driving down to our meeting spot which will probably take me an hour or so to get to. The plan for tonight is to come back up here so I can show Jake and Alex the town and university, then tomorrow we’re going to head back down to Castle Rock.

This is probably the last post I’ll make for a while. I don’t know if I’ll have time or not. We shall see though.
