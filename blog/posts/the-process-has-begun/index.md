Well, the time is quickly approaching that I will be off to Germany. I’ve decided to keep a journal again (as I did when I was in Japan) and this is it. Not as fancy as the other one, but it works.

I’ll be going to the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg ([http://www.uni-oldenburg.de](http://www.uni-oldenburg.de)) in Oldenburg, Germany ([Map](http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Carl+von+Ossietzky+Universit%C3%A4t+Oldenburg&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=32.885543,59.765625&ie=UTF8&ll=53.15673,8.175287&spn=0.012146,0.029182&t=k&z=15&om=1)).

To clarify the details for what’s going on right now:

**Departure:** August 27 from Philadelphia  
**Arrival:** August 28 in Frankfurt; then I’ll take a train to Oldenburg

I’ll be coming back sometime July 2008.
