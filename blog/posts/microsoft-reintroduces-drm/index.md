I read in a [Slashdot post](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/01/22/1914201&from=rss) that Microsoft has reintroduced DRM on music that is purchased using its new MSN Mobile Music service. Apparently, the songs you buy are more expensive than songs on places such as Amazon or iTunes and they are locked to the phone you purchase them on, which means if you upgrade your phone, you lose the songs you purchased. All this at a time when everyone else is shedding the dreadful and cumbersome DRM. As usual, Microsoft is ridiculously out of touch with the rest of the world and reality. I don’t expect this attempt at a music store to work any better at all than any of their other attempts. They just can’t get it right because they lack the common sense and the market-reading capabilities that almost every single other company has.
