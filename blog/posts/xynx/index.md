I would like to introduce [Xynx](http://www.purevolume.com/xynx), my latest project. While my own music here will be for whatever I think sounds good and thus should continue in the familiar style, Xynx will be for dance/techno music.

I decided to split the music up into 2 different projects to help pace the rate at which I release albums. I feel that I release albums under my own name too quickly and that each album doesn’t have its “fair time” to catch on. I also made the decision after coming to the conclusion that it might be a lot easier for people to find the music they really want if it’s better organized. This seemed like a good way to organize it.

The first 2 songs for the album are here on [PureVolume](http://www.purevolume.com/xynx) and are available to listen to for free.
