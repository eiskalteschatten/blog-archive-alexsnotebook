Yesterday I went to a BBQ that lasted 11 hours for me. Andrew (an American exchange student from Michigan) and Hester set it up at the place they live. They decided to have it for whatever in celebration of Empire Day which is an old British holiday during the time of the British Empire. Not sure why they decided to have a BBQ because of it, but it doesn’t matter. It was fun all the same.

I got there at about 7 pm. There were a few people there already and more kept coming. We had shish kabobs, steak and a number of other things which were all good. Then we stood around and chatted until about 2 am. People slowly started leaving at around midnight, but by 2 am everyone other than a German guy named Micheal, a Dutch girl named Dieuwertje and I had left. I have no idea how to pronounce her name and neither did any one else there despite her trying to teach us how to, so everyone just calls her DiDi since that’s a lot easier. We kept on talking for about an hour, then we decided to leave. Since we were all going the same direction, we all rode our bikes together. Then we stopped in front of Hermann Ehlers Haus because Micheal and Deiuwertje both had to go further than I did and we talked some more. About an hour later, Micheal left and Deiuwertje and I continued talking. We ended up standing outside Hermann Ehlers in the cold until 6 am when it was completely light outside. Then we finally decided to go home.

I finally got to sleep at around 7 am. It was a lot of fun though.
