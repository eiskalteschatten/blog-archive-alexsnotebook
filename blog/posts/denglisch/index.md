Denglisch

For those of you who don’t know what the term [“Denglisch”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denglisch) is, it’s a term used by the Germans to describe the English that is constantly working its way into their language. It comes from the German words Deutsch+Englisch (German+English).

The reason I’m bringing this up is because I just got through reading [an article](http://www.computerwoche.de/knowledge_center/software_infrastruktur/1886149/) about Windows 7 in German. The title of the article is “Microsoft pusht Vista-Nachfolger: Windows 7 soll auch auf Netbooks laufen” (Microsoft pushes Vista replacement: Windows 7 should also run on netbooks). Can anyone tell me what’s wrong with the German title? First of all, “pusht” is not German at all. Nor is “Netbooks.” This is a professionally done online magazine article that is riddled with all sorts of Denglisch. While it makes it tremendously easier for me to read being a native English speaker, it’s really quite sad at the same time that they are loosing their language so quickly to these invading anglicisms.

[This](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/germlish.html) is an amusing satirical article that was written in German, but it uses so many English words that someone without really any German experience at all could understand most of it. The point of it is to make fun of Denglisch. It was published in an American newspaper.
