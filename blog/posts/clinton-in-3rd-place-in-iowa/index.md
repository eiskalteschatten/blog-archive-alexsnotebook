Well, I expected that Clinton would lose to Obama in the Iowa caucuses, but I honestly didn’t expect her to also lose to Edwards bringing her into 3rd place in Iowa. This makes me happier than I can describe adequately in words.

> “DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) – Sen. Hillary Clinton placed third in the Iowa Democratic caucus on Thursday, a big setback for the one-time national front-runner in the first nominating contest of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, CNN reported.
> 
> Sen. Barack Obama placed first in the vote and former Sen. John Edwards came in second.
> 
> The third-place finish put pressure on Clinton, the former first lady who is seeking to become the country’s first woman president, to regain her national front-runner status as she heads into the Jan 8. primary vote in New Hampshire.” *(Source: [Reuters](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&storyid=2008-01-04T045704Z_01_N02147164_RTRUKOC_0_US-USA-POLITICS-CLINTON-1.xml))*

I know this is just the beginning and, since everything is so close, anything is still possible. But it’s certainly a good start.
