First of all, I would like to thank everyone who has left feedback for ScratchPad. I have received a lot of really great suggestions and I am very grateful for them all. The next version of ScratchPad is underway and I am trying to incorporate as many of the suggestions Iâ€™ve received into the program as possible. Thank you again!

Second on the list of things to say is that, in order to make translating easier, I have uploaded [a text file](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com/ScratchPad_Strings.txt) with all of the strings used in ScratchPad. The idea behind that is so that anyone interested in translating ScratchPad for me can download and translate the file, then [send back to me](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com/?page_id=26). Simple as that. The file can be found [here](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com/ScratchPad_Strings.txt).
