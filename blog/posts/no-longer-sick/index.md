The past few days have been pretty miserable because I’ve been sick again. This time it was just nasal drainage. I have no idea why my nose suddenly stuffed up, but it did. Today is the first day since Monday or Tuesday that I haven’t had a completely stopped up nose.

The weather here has been really sporadic. 3 days ago, it was so hot and humid that you couldn’t really do anything at all. It was about 95 degrees with 100% humidity. Yesterday was about 40 degrees and it was jeans and coat weather. Today is pretty warm, but fortunately it’s not miserably hot.

Yesterday, I went with Dieuwertje, Katie, Katie’s German boyfriend and Andrew to see the movie All the Boys Love Mandy Lane. It was interesting. There wasn’t much of a plot at all, but there was a lot of gore and death.

Today I’m going to a party at Nina’s. It’s a combination of a going away party for all of the exchange students and a going away party for herself. She is going to be studying abroad again next year in Spain and is going to be leaving soon for that I think. I actually really don’t want to go because I’m so sick of parties, but it will probably be the last get-together we all have before we leave, so I think I ought to.

I have to go get my bike fixed on Tuesday so I can sell it on Wednesday. One of the pedals snapped off, so I have to go get another pedal and put it on. I also have to put about 6 or 7 other pieces of the bike back on that have fallen off since I’ve had it. Either that, or I’m going to throw the piece of junk away. It will probably depend on whether I can fix the pedal or not.
