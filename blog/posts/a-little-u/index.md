I’ve posted my first post to [Manifestly Absurd](http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com). It’s an argument I got into with an Australian friend of mine about the English language.

I’ve also created 2 versions of the blog. I want to do a direct comparison of Blogger vs WordPress and therefore have created a blog of Manifestly Absurd on both. You can choose one and let me know which one you like better. You can find them here:

WordPress – [http://manifestlyabsurd.wordpress.com](http://manifestlyabsurd.wordpress.com)  
Blogger – [http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com](http://manifestlyabsurd.blogspot.com)
