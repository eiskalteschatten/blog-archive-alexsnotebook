ScratchPad finally has a proper website!

Instead of a mixture of free services (Google Pages and Blogger), I have now merged everything into one site hosted with the same host as all of my other web endeavors (including this one) and using my domain name. I hope you enjoy the new site! You can find it here: [http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com).

Please let me know what you think!
