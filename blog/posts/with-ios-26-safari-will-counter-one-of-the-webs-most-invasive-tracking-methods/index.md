As stated above, this feature has been available for a while in Safari and has been on by default for Private Browsing sessions, however, more technically savvy users may already know that you can already enable it for all browsing sessions in current versions of Safari. I’ve had it on for all browsing sessions for a long time on my Macs, my iPhone and my iPad.
