Well, for those of you still watching this journal, I should mention that I am now back in the United States and even back in Wyoming.

Amsterdam was pretty boring because we really didn’t do much other than stay at the hotel and watch Dutch TV. We just didn’t feel like going out and doing anything at all.

My trip home was long and for the most part uneventful. I missed my connecting flight in Chicago because I couldn’t get through customs, immigration and security fast enough. I had to wait for a couple of hours for the next flight, but that really wasn’t a big deal.

It has now been over a year since I first left for Germany in August 2007 and I have to say that it was, for the most part, a great experience. This is probably my last entry, as I really don’t have anything more to write about since I’m no longer in Germany.
