I’m excited to announce that I’ve started my very first podcast over at [Developer’s Notebook](https://www.developers-notebook.com). It’s called The Developer’s Notebook Podcast and [the first episode](https://www.developers-notebook.com/podcast/podcast-1-coping-with-long-meetings-at-work/) has already made its debut.

[The Developer’s Notebook Podcast](https://www.developers-notebook.com/podcast/) is a show that will cater to a nerdy crowd. Much like the website, it will feature topics related to computers, programming, workplace advice for developers, retro computing and more, but will be a bit more conversational and casual.

How to Subscribe
