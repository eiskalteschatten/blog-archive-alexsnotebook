Today is going to be a fun day. I have to work on a written proposal for my research paper that I have to write for my historical methods class. I can hardly wait. Once I actually get around to writing it, it will be extremely easy, but itâ€™s the matter of actually getting to it that is the difficult part I think. The proposal only needs to be about 3 pages long with 1 page summarizing what I intend to write about, the questions I want to answer and the argument I want to write about. The other 2 pages need to be basically an annotated bibliography of sources that I will propose to use. The bibliography needs to include both primary and secondary sources. I have most of the sources I intend to use, now I just have to get around to writing the proposal.
