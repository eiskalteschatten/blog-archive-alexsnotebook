Florida appears to be quite backwards in its thinking. The fact that evolution was controversial in Florida in modern times shows that Florida needs to do a bit of catching up to the rest of the world. Fifty years ago it was a large controversy for the entire nation, but as science has progressed and religious extremism and beliefs have waned, evolution has rightfully taken a strong grip on the nation. Even if only taught as a theory, however, at least it did pass and will be taught in public schools at all.
