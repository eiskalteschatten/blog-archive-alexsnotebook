Well I thought I would try another new theme because I didn’t really like the last one I tried after being ‘ousted by flowers’ from my original theme. I think I actually rather like this one. It’s a lot cleaner and easier to read than the last one I tried.

I made the header image with a photo I took while I was in Japan. It is the roof of a famous temple in Kyoto called 金閣寺 or the Golden Pavilion in English.

Let me know what you think of the new theme selection!
