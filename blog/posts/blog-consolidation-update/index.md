After some consideration and the shutting down of a couple of my other blogs, I think I am just going to continue with my blogs as such. I have reduced the number to three (this one, [Es Wird Kalt](http://www.eswirdkalt.com) and [History Rhymes](http://www.historyrhymes.info)) and I think that will suffice. That is much better than the seven which I had before.

My decision lies in the fact that most of the readers of History Rhymes read the blog for history and not for anything else. So Iâ€™ve decided to keep it separate and write only about history on that blog. Everything else will be here.
