I would like to introduce my new manager, Scott Richards. He will be helping me in a number of ways. Firstly, he will be the primary contact for press and public relations. He will also be helping me keep my website up to date with the latest news and information as well as helping keep [my Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/seifertmusic) active. News posted by Scott will be marked below the article by the text “By Scott”. Articles written by me (like this one) will be marked with “By Alex”.

I am extremely please to have Scott on board and I wish him the greatest of luck helping me manage everything!

If you have any questions, please contact Scott at [music@alexseifert.com](mailto:music@alexseifert.com).
