ScratchPad version 1.1 has been released! It’s recommended that everyone updates to take advantage of some of the new features such as:

-   Users can now navigate to a specific page by typing in a page number in a toolbar item or by selecting an option in the Page menu.
-   ScratchPad now remembers the last page the user used. This can be disabled in the Preferences.
-   Pages can now be exported.

For more details about the update and what has changed, see the [Release Notes](http://seifertalex.googlepages.com/scratchpadreleasenotes).
