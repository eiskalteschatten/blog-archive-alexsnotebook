I was browsing the web today and ran across the newly released videos of Korn’s Unplugged session with MTV. On MTV’s website, you can find the videos for the songs “Blind”, “Freak on a Leash” (featuring Amy Lee from Evanescence), “Falling Away From Me”, “Creep”, “Got the Life”, “Twisted Transistor”, “Coming Undone”, “Make Me Bad/In Between Days” (featuring Robert Smith from The Cure) and “Throw Me Away”. All of them, of course, done acoustically.

Although I’m not a big fan of acoustic music like this and I prefer the originals by far, it still wasn’t terrible. Any Korn fan should enjoy listening to them and watching the videos.

You can find the videos for free on MTV’s website: [http://www.mtv.com](http://www.mtv.com/#/music/unplugged/detail.jhtml?contentId=1552901)
