The Tales of Fate are very short and very odd pieces of writing I wrote many years ago and as such, I feel an explanation is necessary. Thus far I’ve posted only four of them, but there are eight total.

Now for a bit of background information. I began writing them towards the end of high school which was a relatively dark period for me. The stories, therefore, are quite dark. Originally they were written in German as I was starting to learn the language and then I translated them into English. That is why they are so simple and short as my German was not very good at that time.

In writing them, I was somewhat inspired by Natsume Soseki’s Ten Nights of Dreams which consists of ten very short stories that are equally as odd and dark. Soseki was a very dark author and his work is very comparable to that of Edgar Allen Poe. But I digress.

The Tales of Fate are nothing more than simple situational stories with a dark twist. I have not written any for years, so after I have posted all eight of them, there will not be anymore. I will begin posting more of my recent writings which are considerably better in my opinion.
