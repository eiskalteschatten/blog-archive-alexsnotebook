Well, there’s some good news for Slipknot fans out there. It looks likes they’ll finally be coming out with a new album.

*“San Antonio, Texas’ Kiss FM is reporting that SLIPKNOT will in fact be releasing another studio album, and will begin recording sometime before 2007 is out. In the interim, STONE SOUR will proceed as planned with Jim Root and Corey Taylor spending some adequate time on the road through summer.”*
