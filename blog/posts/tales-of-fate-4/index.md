I want to die. But I can’t do that. I’m sure I’ll die of dehydration before this damn rope kills me.

The desert is very very hot and expansive. I can’t see anything. I don’t want to see anything. I’m here entirely alone and I’m waiting for death. My hands are tied and my feet reach for the ground. They’re out of reach though.

I’m thirsty but I continue to cry. I’m sure there’s only one tree tree in the entire desert. And I’m still hanging from it; waiting for death.
