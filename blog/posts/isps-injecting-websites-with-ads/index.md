> “Last July, a research team from the University of Washington released an online tool to analyze whether web pages were being altered during the transit from web server to user. On Wednesday, the team released a paper at the Usenix conference analyzing the data collected from the tool. The found, unsurprisingly, that ISPs were indeed injecting ads into web pages viewed by a small number of users. The paper is available at the Usenix site.” *(Source: [Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/18/0118256&from=rss))*

ISPs should not have any right to alter webpage content whatsoever, much less inject ads into websites that normally don’t contain any ads. That’s *especially* if you’re paying for their service in the first place.

It seems to me that that should be considered spamming or even vandalizing. As a web developer, the kinds of websites I work on generally don’t have any sort of ads on theem. I don’t want my visitors to have to see ads if I haven’t originally intended the website to have ads.
