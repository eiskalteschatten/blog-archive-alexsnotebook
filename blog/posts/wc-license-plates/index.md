\[digg=http://digg.com/offbeat\_news/WC\_License\_Plates\]I’m going to first start off by saying that I have absolutely nothing against the Chinese. The second thing I’m going to say is that they have some extremely odd peculiarities.

The latest oddity appearing here in the news is over the initials “WC” being placed on license plates. Now I can understand not wanting “Water Closet” on your car, but a license plate is a license plate. It doesn’t mean anything other than that your car is registered; WC or no WC. A couple of letters on your license plate shouldn’t reflect on the owner nor make him “a laughing stock among \[his\] friends” which is what a man named Zhang said the letters would make hims.

I’ve seen plenty of cars in the USA which have the three letters “ASS”. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the car has an ass on it nor does it make the owner of that car an ass. It simply means those are three letters on the license plate.
