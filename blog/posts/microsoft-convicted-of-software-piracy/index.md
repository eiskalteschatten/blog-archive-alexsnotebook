\[digg=http://www.digg.com/microsoft/Microsoft\_Convicted\_of\_Software\_Piracy\]I know this is old, but it’s new to me, so bear with me. I came across a news article today that dates back five years ago to 2002, but I found to be somewhat humorous.

In 2001, Microsoft was found guilty in French courts of software piracy. When Microsoft ported SoftImage’s 3D animation software of the same name from SGI’s Irix operating system to Windows, it illegally included third party code. They were fined what would be $549,451 today.

The conviction was and still is quite ironic because Microsoft is one of the industry’s top anti-piracy companies. The ordeal was also surprisingly left out of the news for the most part at the time, which is probably due to it happening so close to the September 11 attack on the twin towers in New York City.

I just thought that this was an interesting bit of old news. If you want to read the full article, you can find it here: [http://www.vnunet.com](http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2118681/microsoft-convicted-software-piracy)
