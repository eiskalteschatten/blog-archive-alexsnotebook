I found [an interesting program](http://www.lexcycle.com/) for the iPod Touch and iPhone called [Stanza](http://www.lexcycle.com/). The program allows you to essentially use your iPod Touch or iPhone as an eBook reader. You can buy books directly from a browser within Stanza which connects to a large list of databases to find exactly the book youâ€™re looking for. One of my favorite parts though is that I can download my favorite Mark Twain books for free from sites such as [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) which have posted the full texts to books whose copyrights have expired.

Stanza on an iPhone

The program also comes in a desktop form for both Windows and Mac OS X which I have actually found to be an extremely nice alternative to just reading out of a web browser or reading PDFs.

You can download Stanza for free for the iPod Touch/iPhone, Windows or Mac OS X here: [http://www.lexcycle.com/download](http://www.lexcycle.com/download).
