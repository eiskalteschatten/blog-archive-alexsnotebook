Couldnâ€™t you see it?

I was walking alone. From the endless black road on which I travelled, you could see nothing but the enormous desert. The sun was hot and the head was dry. A dead lizard was lying on the road.

I was completely alone and I wondered if I would survive the walk to the next city. Then the thing came. I first heard the awful noise of the wings and turned around calmly. It then seized me in its large legs. It grabbed my head and picked me up into the air. We went higher and higher until the road looked like nothing more than a small line.

Then the thing let me go. The sound of it slowly faded and I could only here the quiet air. Everything was peaceful. I closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable.
