Well, I’ve posted the eighth and final installment of my Tales of Fate series. I decided to just quickly post them all so I can move on. From here on out, I will be posting better and more normal short stories. I’ve still got several to post and will spend the next several weeks posting them I think. I am still trying to decide on a decent format for posting some of the longer ones. Perhaps I will break them up into several different posts so they are not exceedingly long posts.

I’ve also just finished one of the books I’ve been working on for the past couple of months. Really, I do read a lot, but I tend to read three or four books at a time, meaning that they take a bit longer to read. The book I just finished is called *100 Vicious Little Vampire Stories* edited by Robert Weinberg, Stefan Dziemianowicz and Martin Greenberg. As the title implies, it is a collection of short vampire stories. I really don’t know why, but I’ve always found short stories more entertaining than longer stories. It’s possible that my attention span is not up to the task of focusing on a long story. That could also explain my tendency to read several books at once.
