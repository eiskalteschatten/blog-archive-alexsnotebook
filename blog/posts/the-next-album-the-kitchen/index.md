The title has finalized for the next album. The new album will be called “The Kitchen” as I mentioned in the last post. The artwork has also been finalized. This is what the album cover looks like:

As of yet, there is no release date, but check back here later for one.

I have also uploaded one of the songs from the album on [PureVolume](http://www.purevolume.com/alexseifert). The song is called “Calling the Circuits”.
