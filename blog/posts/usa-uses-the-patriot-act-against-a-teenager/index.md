I am sure that most of you have seen this video or at least have heard about this. A teenager in North Carolina was taken in the middle of the night by federal agents because he was suspected of being a terrorist.

As the video states, the mother has had virtually no contact with her son. In all likelihood the boy probably will not even have a proper chance to defend himself. Who knows what will happen to him?

Ironically the federal government seems to be using the excuse of patriotism to undermine the very rights inherent to every US citizen they are claiming to defend. I really don’t understand it. Even if this boy was in fact a terrorist, as a US citizen, he is entitled to due process. But of course the KGB, I mean the FBI, doesn’t agree.
