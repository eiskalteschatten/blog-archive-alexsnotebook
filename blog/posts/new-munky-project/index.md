From the [official website](http://www.korn.com):

> “KoRn guitarist James ‘Munky’ Shaffer announces plans to release a new project entitled FEAR AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM due out fall of 2008. The record will be released on his own label, EMOTIONAL SYPHON RECORDINGS.
> 
> The band features James Christian Shaffer (“Munky”) on guitars and vocals; Billy Gould (Faith No More), bass; Wes Borland (Black Light Burns), guitars; Brooks Wackerman (Bad Religion, Tenacious D), drums and percussion; Leopold Ross, programming and guitars; Zach Baird, keyboards and programming. The album will be produced by Shaffer, Ross, and Jim Monti, with additional production by Tim Harkins.
> 
> Famed producer and friend Ross Robinson (Slipknot, KoRn) comments: “What can I do to ever come close to feeling James’s level of pure ruthless courage through a guitar? Since I’ve worked with him, I’ve tried to inspire, convince, beg, bleed, cry, prod and nearly die, hoping to hit that bar with others. I’m grateful to know what ‘it’ is, and where it always exists—in my brother, James. His solo band? Yes, please!”
> 
> The songs are being recorded at Music Grinder Studios in Hollywood, CA, with Jim Monti handling the mixing duties. Fear and The Nervous System is an exciting project that opens up the boundaries of rock, harkening back to the days when music was fearless.
