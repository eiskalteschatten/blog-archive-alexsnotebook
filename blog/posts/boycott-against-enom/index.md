> “On the 28th of February, 2008 while everyone was paying attention to the WIKILEAKS.ORG censorship case, another Wikileaks domain, WIKILEAKS.INFO, was unlawfully locked and seized. The censoring company was domain name registrar eNom, Inc of Bellevue, Washington. eNom is the second largest registrar of domain names with 8.6 million internet domains names under its “control”.

> eNom was also cited in the March 4, 2008 edition of New York Times this week for censoring a Spanish travel company with flights to Cuba.

> In addition Wikileaks has discovered a previously unreported eNom proposal from last year to bulk-release customer records to government agencies. The plan is to convert the entire internet domain system to into “Secure Blobs for Law Enforcement”, a big-brother scheme redolent of the NSA CLIPPER chip fiasco.Not content to roll over eNom customer records when asked, eNom has apparently realized it can decrease subpoena processing costs by giving away domain holders confidential information to government agencies en-mass. eNom’s idea is to encrypt registrant’s confidential information and attach it to every public “whois” record. This would allow law enforcement, or anyone else with a decryption key, to obtain all confidential records automatically. Not content to undermine the 1st amendment, eNom apparently has plans to do away with the 4th as well.
