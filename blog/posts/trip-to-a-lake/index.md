Well, not much has happened this weekend. I did almost nothing yesterday, which is kind of nice every once in a while.

Today some of the other Americans, the Russian guy, the Australian and the British girl all went to a lake north of Oldenburg. I have no idea what the lake is called, but it was a lot of fun. Today was particularly warm, so it was a good day to go do it.
