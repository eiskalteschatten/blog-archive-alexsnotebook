I find it absurd that the presidential candidates have to now have debates on Spanish-language TV in the US. While I am not opposed to Spanish or any foreign language (I teach German), I find the idea that American candidates for the presidency have to now have specific debates for the Spanish-speaking minority absolutely absurd. English should be a requirement when it comes to living in the US and we should now have to cater to those who refuse to learn it, but want to live here. I would have to agree with Tom Tancredo:

> “…Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, refused to attend the debate because he objected to the Spanish language format.”

Again, I’m not opposed to Spanish or to Spanish-speakers being in the US, I just find the idea of catering to them because they won’t learn English ridiculous.
