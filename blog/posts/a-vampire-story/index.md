I’ve embarked on a new quest to write a story. This one is going to be extremely unique, however. I’ve decided to do it by using a blog. The blog will be “kept” by the so-called vampire that the story is about. The posts will be about this vampire’s daily activities, his past, his observations, etc. You can find the blog/story here: [http://wechselfaelle.wordpress.com](http://wechselfaelle.wordpress.com)

I’ve only just begun the project and I have no idea what to expect from it, but hopefully it will turn out decent. I’ve never done anything like this before and I’ve never actually seen it down before either. We’ll see how it turns out though.

Again, the website is here: [http://wechselfaelle.wordpress.com](http://wechselfaelle.wordpress.com)
