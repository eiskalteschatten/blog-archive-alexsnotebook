For all of you fellow drummers out there, I think there is something I should call to your attention.

After mindlessly surfing through YouTube, I came across a user by the name of djp132, or Derrick. Derrick provides instruction videos of various drum methods that you might find worth watching. The videos are all homemade, but they are filmed well enough that that doesn’t interfere with the lessons.

Here is one of his videos, in which he teaches about the Heel-Toe method on the bass drum:

You can find a complete catalogue of Derrick’s lessons on his YouTube page: [http://www.youtube.com/user/djp132](http://www.youtube.com/user/djp132)
