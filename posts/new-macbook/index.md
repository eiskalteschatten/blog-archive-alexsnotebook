Yesterday I was finally able to order a brand new MacBook. Iâ€™m quite excited about it because it means I can finally rid myself of the stupid PC laptop with Windows Vista that I have been using now for a while. I hate that thing. Vista is slow, sloppy, ugly, unreliable and generally obnoxious to work with.

But anyway, that means that development on ScratchPad can continue as soon as the MacBook comes in and I get it all setup. Again, I want to apologize for the delay in development.
