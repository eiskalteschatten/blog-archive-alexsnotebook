I seem to be past my creative block. Yesterday, I finished the song I talked about in my previous post. As I said I probably would then, I did end up changing the title. It’s now called “Rocks and Cliffs”. It’s more fitting to the actual music I think because of the bass line I use. The bass has a very loose, slapbass sound that I think works really well for the song actually.

Today alone I made 2 new songs. I made one called “Sourd Jusque La Fin” (French for “Voiceless until the end”) and one called “Von Judas” (German for “From Judas”). Sourd Jusque La Fin has a very industrial sound that I really like. Von Judas is somewhat darker than the rest of the songs on the upcoming album, Parlour, but I’m still really pleased about the way it turned out. I posted it on [Purevolume](http://www.purevolume.com/alexseifert). You can listen to it there for free.
