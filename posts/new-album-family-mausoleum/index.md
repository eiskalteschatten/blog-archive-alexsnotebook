I am very excited to announce that my next major album will be set for release on 2 February 2012. In keeping with the theme of album names, the album is will duly be called “Family Mausoleum” as it generally has a darker mood to it. This is my first major release in two years!

More information about it, including the track listing, will be made available shortly. You can find the new album cover below:
