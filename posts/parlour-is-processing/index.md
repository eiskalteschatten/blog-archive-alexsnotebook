In an earlier entry, I mentioned that Parlour would hopefully be in stores in time for its release on November 16. Unfortunately it took a lot longer than expected. The album is finally undergoing processing which means it should be available in stores rather shortly.

I apologize that it’s taking so long. Unfortunately things just happen like that sometimes…

I’ll make a post here when the album is finally available in stores. Keep checking back until then!
