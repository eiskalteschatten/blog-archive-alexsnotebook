One of the security measures within Apple’s new version of OS X, Mountain Lion (10.8), is called Gatekeeper. This is essentially a means of blocking the running of all applications for OS X which are either not downloaded from the Mac App Store or are not signed by a certificate given to the developer by Apple saying that the application is safe. By default, this will be enabled, meaning that ScratchPad will not run.

I have looked into getting a signed certificate for ScratchPad so that it will be considered one of the “safe applications”, but the problem is that you have to fork over $99 a year for a subscription to Apple’s developer program in order to get one. I cannot afford to spend that money at the moment, meaning ScratchPad will unfortunately have to remain unsigned and therefore incompatible with Gatekeeper’s default settings.

ScratchPad will still be able to run on Mountain Lion, but Gatekeeper will have to be disabled in the System Preferences first. For now, as a temporary solution until I can afford to spend the money on Apple’s developer program, I will create and post instructions for disabling Gatekeeper. I will post more here as I learn more about it.
