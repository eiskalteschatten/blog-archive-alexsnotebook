I’m very happy to announce that my brother, [Kyle Seifert](https://www.facebook.com/kyleseifertauthor/), has published his first novel called *[Numb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56539240-numb)*. It is a sinister crime novel that takes place in a small ski-town in the mountains and features the descent of a man into a murderous killing spree. Here is the description from the back:

> *That downward spiral into madness and murder, what better way to satisfy those dark urges than in a small mountain town full of vacation goers?*

I’ve read it and can highly recommend it not because Kyle is my brother, but because the book itself is well-written and tells a captivating story.
