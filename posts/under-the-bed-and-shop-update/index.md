Alex has asked me to post an update about the status of the shop.

The first piece of news is that *Under the Bed* is now available in the [shop](https://www.alexseifertmusic.com/shop/)! The rest of the albums that arenâ€™t there yet will be there soon. All of them have been submitted and are currently being processed by Apple. Hopefully we will see them show up in the iTunes Music Store soon.

Work on t-shirts, hats and other merchandise is still being done. We are hopeful that they will arrive in the shop soon. As soon as they are there, we will post an update here, so please check back regularly to see when the items will be available.
