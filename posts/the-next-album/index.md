Work on the next album, is well underway. I have a name for it already, but the artwork is seeming to take a while because I am currently fresh out of ideas. The new album will be called *The Living Room*. I was thinking about making some sort of cover that would be like looking down on a coffee table of some sort with a coaster and a water ring, but I don’t know. If I decide to do that, then that would mean I’d have to figure out how to make it. We’ll see.
