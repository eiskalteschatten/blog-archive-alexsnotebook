I apologize that it has been forever since I have updated ScratchPad or even the news site here. Times flies when you get busy with other thingsâ€¦ Anyway, this is meant to be a quick update. I have been working on and off on a new project, which as my last post here explains, is called ScratchBook. Again, as the last post said, the idea behind ScratchPad is to keep it as absolutely simple as possible, so I thought a new project would be a good idea so that I can incorporate many of the most-requested features for ScratchPad.

As of yet, unfortunately I do not have a time I can give for the release of ScratchBook. I am working on it, I promise. But I only have very little time to actually work on it. Hopefully it will be done relatively soon. I will keep you posted here.
