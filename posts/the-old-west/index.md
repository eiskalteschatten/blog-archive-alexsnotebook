I’m excited to announce a new project I’ve started that combines both my love of history with my passion for web development and technology. The project is called [The Old West](https://www.the-old-west.com/) and, as the name suggests, is about the old west in the United States.

Here is a blurb about it from its “about” page:

> The Old West is a website that aims to bring the old American wild west to the internet in a fun and interactive way. The project is run as a hobby by [Alex Seifert](https://www.alexseifert.com/) with the hope that others who enjoy the old west will find it as interesting as he does.

The website is based on the React framework, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and is statically generated.
