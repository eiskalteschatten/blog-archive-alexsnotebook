Just a quick note about the new News Archive. As part of the on going process of redesigning the website, I’ve decided to include a news archive. Unfortunately, this archive will not be very extensive because many of the older news articles could not be found. I plan to keep searching for them. I know I have them and that it’s just a matter of finding them, but it may take a while. For now, however, I am just going to concentrate on getting the new site up and running, then I will worry about filling in the archives.
