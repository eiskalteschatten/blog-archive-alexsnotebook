As part of a new marketing strategy for Parlour, I’m willing to make a deal. The deal is as follows:

I’m offering my newest album, Parlour, as a free, high quality download. You then have the option to support the artist by making a donation for whatever price you think the album is worth. There is no minimum or maximum to the amount that you can donate. Every bit helps.
