I have decided that as part of my on going efforts of connecting with fans of my music, that I would open a blog. You can find the blog at [http://www.alexseifert.com/blog](http://www.alexseifert.com/blog). My plan is to keep it up to date with all of the latest happenings in my musical life, my thoughts about my music as I create it, etc.

This will be different than the [News](http://www.alexseifert.com/news) section of the website in that it will be less formal and more personal. The News section will be used for announcements and the sort, whereas this will be thoughts and opinions as I create my music.

Check back here often for more updates! Also, you can subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AlexSeifertBlog) to keep up to date!
