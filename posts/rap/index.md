I’ll be honest. I hate listening to rap.

Why do I bring this up? Because there are going to be some tracks with rap on them on my next album. I’ll post them as they become available.

You’re probably wondering why I would have tracks with rap on them if I hate rap. Well, here’s my answer: because hearing music you made with someone else’s vocals laid on top of it is freaking awesome. Also because I had an excellent opportunity to be able to work with a guy I met from Africa who can rap well and was looking for someone to come up with some music for his rap. Say hello to John-Francis.

Just to clarify. There will only be maybe 1 or 2 songs on my album. The rest will be great new instrumentals. I’ll be working with him on several more songs as well, but they will be for his own album.

What are your thoughts on it?
