I am very pleased to announce that three of my songs have been uploaded to the BBC to be played on their [“Introducing in Sheffield”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p001d7w7) programme. The following three songs have made it to the BBC: [Come and Gone](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/the-attic-greatest-hits/id445191536) from “The Attic” and two surprise, unreleased tracks from my new album! The new tracks will probably be released soon as singles, so watch for them here!

I will post more details here when I hear back from the BBC about play times.
