I am excited to announce that [Developer’s Notebook](https://www.developers-notebook.com) is in the process of being rebranded to [Feed The Dev](https://www.feedthedev.com/)! With the new platform, comes a new name and, at some point in the future, a new logo and new features.

The purpose of the rebranding is multifaceted. First and foremost, it should reflect the goal of our website. We want to “feed” developers with interesting articles, useful tips and experiences as well as news and other development-related information. The new name more clearly reflects this.

There are also a number of other reasons why this rebranding is taking place and a lot of them have to do with future plans we have for the website. I’m not going to talk about them in this post, but it will make more sense once we start releasing them.

Changing a brand takes time a lot of work, so bear with us while we change the name on [GitHub](https://github.com/Developers-Notebook), social media, [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/P5P4LKZM5) and other websites. We will also add redirects from the old website to the new one so that any old links will still work as expected.

We hope you enjoy what we have planned as well as the content we already have. Any feedback is welcome which can be sent to us via the [contact page](https://www.feedthedev.com/contact/).
