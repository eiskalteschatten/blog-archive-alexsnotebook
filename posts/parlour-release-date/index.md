Well, I’ve finally got a release date for Parlour! The date will be Friday, November 16.

Hopefully it will be in the music stores by then as well. I’ll post here again when it’s available in the music stores if it’s not by then. Parlour has also been added to my library of music at [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Seifert/+albums). It is available there for everyone to listen to. I’m very excited about this release. I think it’s going to be great.
