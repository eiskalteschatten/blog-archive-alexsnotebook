As an avid reader, I’m always eager to share a good book once I’m finished with it. Usually, I read both fiction and non-fiction, but I found so many good novels to read in 2022, that I never got around to tackling my non-fiction pile. Of all the novels I read, these are the books that stood out from the pack.

**[*The Death of Jane Lawrence* by Caitlin Starling](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Jane-Lawrence-Novel/dp/1250272580?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1673341171&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=afb8b350bec55dd7fc4cbee8eb21880b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**

I’ll start with the last book I read in 2022. For fans of modern gothic novels, this is a must-read as it is one of the most creative and original stories I have read in a while. It follows the classical gothic tropes, but also dips into horror while examining the human psyche. The story is odd and gets stranger as it progresses, but that is exactly what makes this one stand out from pack.

[***Craven Manor* by Darcey Coates**](https://www.amazon.com/Craven-Manor-Darcy-Coates/dp/1728220157?keywords=craven+manor+by+darcy+coates&qid=1673792879&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=bf1251e801139af93366552844c00558&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

*Craven Manor* is in every since a typical haunted house story. For fans of the genre, this is a very pleasurable read, however, as it puts an interesting spin on a traditional genre without deviating from it too much. There are evil ghosts, but there are also good ones. Also, watch out for the cat!

**[*The Carrow Haunt* by Darcey Coates](https://www.amazon.com/Carrow-Haunt-Darcy-Coates/dp/1728221722?crid=1UM70NYNKAY1J&keywords=the+carrow+haunt+by+darcy+coates&qid=1673792975&sprefix=the+carrow+haunt+by+darcey+coates%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=76a87e6963b6edb3d36c0e77c67c368e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**

Most stories by Darcey Coates involve haunted houses and this one is no exception. For me, there is nothing better than a classic ghost story featuring large, decrepit mansions with unruly spirits. This one certainly does not disappoint!

**[*Home Before Dark* by Riley Sager](https://www.amazon.com/Home-Before-Dark-Riley-Sager/dp/1524745197?crid=QW5NOM18D7QY&keywords=Home+Before+Dark+by+Riley+Sager&qid=1673793078&s=books&sprefix=home+before+dark+by+riley+sager%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C171&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=a366e3c2d28ca3d7900c1ab3082dec6f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**

I love a good twist and this one delivers. Like others in this list, the story is centered around a haunted house (notice a trend?) and an unsolved mystery that influences the protagonist and everything that happens in the story. It might also just have something to do with that twist…

**[*Empire of the Vampire* by Jay Kristoff](https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Vampire-1/dp/1250246512?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1673793105&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=24befcc947defc616684ee773b2841c8&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**

This is the first book in the list to not be from the wider horror genre. *Empire of the Vampire* is an excellent dark fantasy book that focuses on vampires, half-vampires and humans fighting for control over their country. It is a long read, but definitely worth the time. This is part one of more to come.

**[*The Return of the King* by J.R.R. Tolkein](https://www.amazon.com/Return-King-Being-Third-Rings/dp/054792819X?pd_rd_w=noow0&content-id=amzn1.sym.3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_r=M1Z796KQT5F954RTZG9S&pd_rd_wg=kFAqy&pd_rd_r=b790fd9b-d3ec-4ce1-b715-5306e293e534&pd_rd_i=054792819X&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=338cc03b72106a59f41e341eadaa47f5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**

Yes, yes, I know. This one is a classic. I should have read a long time ago, etc. Well, I didn’t. I read it in 2022 and it was excellent. I don’t think it needs much of an introduction, so I won’t say anything more.

**[*Kingdom of the Wicked* by Kerri Maniscalco](https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Wicked-1/dp/0316428450?crid=1WT6KEX2KQ9CQ&keywords=Kingdom+of+the+Wicked+by+Kerri+Maniscalco%5C&qid=1673793162&s=books&sprefix=kingdom+of+the+wicked+by+kerri+maniscalco%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C173&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=alexsnotebook-20&linkId=d83e8a708b1b18b46c178cce3c62c5e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**

This is a creative take on old-world witches mixed with the Christian concepts of heaven and hell. While firmly planted in the fantasy genre, it is a love story at heart. This is part one of three.

So there we are, my favorite books I read in 2022. I did read more than is on this list, but these were the novels that stood out to me and that I enjoyed the most. Some were quick reads whereas others where quite long. Some I read in German, others I read in English. But in the end, they were excellent pieces of literature I am happy to recommend to anyone who is interested.
