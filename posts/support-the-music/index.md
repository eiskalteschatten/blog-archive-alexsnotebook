I need your help!

I’m embarking on a promotional campaign to try to spread my music to more eager listeners, but I can’t do it alone. If you like my music and would like to help me out, I would be **extremely** grateful. I have come up with some suggestions that will take hardly any effort, but are extremely effective. You can find them on the [Support the Music](http://alexseifertmusic.wordpress.com/support-the-music) page.

Here are some banners you can use as well:
