I am very proud to announce the final tracklisting and the album artwork for my upcoming greatest hits album, “The Attic”. These are the tracks in the order they will appear on the album:

1.  What’s Mine
2.  Foreigner
3.  2021
4.  Dschungel
5.  Come and Gone
6.  Clubman
7.  Kips
8.  Calling the Circuits
9.  Kansas Highway
10.  100 Years
11.  The Goth
12.  Aniram
13.  A Trek through the Woods
14.  Snow Falls Slowly
15.  新幹線 (Shinkansen)

The decision was a tough one. There are a few songs which we felt deserved to make it to the greatest hits album, but unfortunately, we can only have so many on there. This listing is what I personally feel are some of my best songs and some which have gotten the best feedback.

We so far do not have a release date, but it will be posted here as soon as we have one.
