The first update to ScratchPad, version 1.1, is almost finished and contains a few new features and some updates as well. Here is a list of some of the things to expect from the new version:

-   The ability to type in a page number and go directly to it without having to scroll through the pages to find the page you want.
-   When the program closes, it will remember which page number you were last on.
-   A new section in the preferences will allow the user to set a custom default font and color for new pages.
-   Various bug fixes.

I don’t have a specific release date yet, but it should be relatively soon.
