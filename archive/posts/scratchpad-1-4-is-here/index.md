After nearly four years without an update, a new version of ScratchPad has finally appeared! It has been updated to look at home in Snow Leopard and Lion and now also includes support for synchronization across multiple computers via Dropbox. The icon has also been recreated since the old one sorely needed some attention. See the release notes below:
