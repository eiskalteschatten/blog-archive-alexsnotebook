As my very first post here, I would like to announce the creation of a FAQ page. We are making an effort to answer some of the questions Alex’s fans typically have. As such, I would like to ask everyone what questions they have.

Some questions which are already on the plan are:

-   Can I use Alex’s music for my project?
-   Can I play Alex’s music in public such as in a club or at a public event?
-   Where can I download Alex’s music?
-   What if an album I would like to buy is not in the Shop?
-   Can Alex make custom music for my project?
-   I am also a musician. Will Alex do a collaboration project with me?
-   How can I contact Alex?
-   What kind of equipment does Alex use?

If you have any questions you would like to see answered on the FAQ page, please post them in the comments below or send them to [music@alexseifert.com](mailto:music@alexseifert.com).

Thank you!
