I am excited to announce the first public release of a program I have been working on for the past year or so. It is called BookJournal and is exactly what the name says it is: a digital book journal.

The program is open-source and free. It also runs on Windows, macOS or Linux.

Features
--------

-   Show reading statistics including how many books and pages you have read in a given year
