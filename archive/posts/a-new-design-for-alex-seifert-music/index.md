I am happy to announce that [my official music website](https://www.alexseifertmusic.com) has received a brand new design. The previous design was nearly five years old and was branded very heavily for the release of my album, “Cellar”. While the new design uses elements from “Cellar” as well, it is designed to be easily updated for future releases…

The website is based off of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and is optimized for performance both on desktop and mobile.
