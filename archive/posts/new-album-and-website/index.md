The Tower Room

I am pleased to announce that my newest album, “The Tower Room”, was released on 7 March 2015. It took a while for it to be distributed to the various online shops and music services, which is why I am just now posting this. As of now, it is available on the [iTunes Music Store](itms://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/the-tower-room/id978141703). Not only was the album released, but I also released the new design for [my music website](https://www.alexseifertmusic.com). It is a dark design which fits the music much better than the previous design.

The whole website is actually just one page. Elements are shown and hidden with jQuery and animated with jQuery UI. The hash tag in the URL tells the JavaScript which set of elements it should show. It was an interesting approach to the project and I am rather proud of how it turned out. Of course, like all of my websites now, it is a secure website accessed via HTTPS rather than HTTP.

Also new is the logo and [the music page](https://www.alexseifert.com/music) on my portfolio. I updated the logo to also be a bit more gothic and old-looking to better fit the new direction of my music. The logo also just simply desperately needed an update. The music page on my portfolio was updated to match the new design of my music website.

More details about the release of “The Tower Room” can be found on [the announcement on my music website](https://www.alexseifertmusic.com/archives/2015/03/20/the-tower-room-is-released-with-new-website-and-logo/).
