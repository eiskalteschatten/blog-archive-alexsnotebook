I have finally put together a really short FAQ from some of the most frequent questions I get. You can find the FAQ [here](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com/?page_id=32).

I have also posted the source for ScratchPad which can be found as a zip file [here](http://scratchpad.alexseifert.com/Scratchpad_Source.zip). You need Mac OS 10.4.11 or higher and Xcode 2.4.1 or higher to build it.
