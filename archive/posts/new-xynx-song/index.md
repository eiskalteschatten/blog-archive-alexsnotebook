I’ve finished a new Xynx song. You can find it on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Xynx/The+New+Government). It’s called Big Brother.

The new Xynx album should hopefully be done soon. We should also be getting a website for Xynx going soon. I hope anyway.

Check back here for when the album is released!
