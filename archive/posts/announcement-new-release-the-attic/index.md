I would like to officially announce my next release: “The Attic”. The album will be a collection of my greatest hits and most popular songs. It will be a great place to start if you are new to my music and are looking for some of the most loved tracks.

Alongside of my most popular songs will also be a new, never before released song called “Dschungel” (German for “jungle”).

I do not have a release date for the album as of yet as everything is being compiled and readied. As soon as I have a release date as well as a final track listing, I will announce them here.
