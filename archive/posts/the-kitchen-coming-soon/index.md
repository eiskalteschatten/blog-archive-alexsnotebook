My new album, The Kitchen, is coming soon. Some final issues are being worked out and then it should be ready for release! As of now, I donâ€™t have a release date to give you, but check back here for more information as it becomes available.

The album will consist of two volumes with a total of 31 tracks! It is by far the largest album I have ever done as I seemed to just go on a creative streak.
